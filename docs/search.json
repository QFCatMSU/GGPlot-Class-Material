    "text": "4 Reshaping the data frame\nThe generally accepted ggplot solution for plotting multiple columns in a data frame is to reshape the data frame.  I do not like this solution because it involves manipulating the data frame in an unintuitive manor, but it is a widely-used technique you should be familiar with.\n \nThe basic steps are (Figure 4):\n\nMove the data from all the columns you want to plot into one column (in red). In this example, all temperature values from the seven columns go into one column.\nExpand the column names to a new column (in blue). In this example, the columns names are the years.\nExpand the row names to a new column (in green). In this example, the rows names are the date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The original data frame (31 rows, 7 columns) and the reshaped (melted) data frame (217 rows, 3 columns)\n\n\n\n\n4.1 Comparing original and reshaped data frame\nThe original data frame has 7 columns, representing the seven years of temperature data, each column has 31 rows – so, 217 temperature values in all.\n \nIn the reshaped data frame, we put all 217 temperature values from the seven columns in one column. This is called melting a data frame.  So, the reshaped data frame will have 217 rows.\n \nThe rows and column names of the original data frame (Figure 2) have information about the date (1-31) and year (2016-2022).  We need to maintain the year and date information across every row in the reshaped data frame meaning we need to create a column for the date and the year.\n \nThe reshaped data frame will have 217 rows (31*7) and three columns: temperature, year, and date ( Figure 4 )\n\n\n4.2 Creating the reshaped data frame\nWe can use the reshape() function to create the new data frame.\n \nIn this new data frame we need to \n\ncombine the seven temperature columns into one column\nmaintain the year (original column names) and date (original row names) information in new columns\n\n  Jan_Avg_Melt = reshape(data=Jan_Avg,        # data frame to manipulate\n                    direction=\"long\",         # how to manipulate (long form) \n                    varying=c(1:7),           # columns to combine (melt)\n                    v.name=\"temperatures\",    # name of combined column\n                    times=colnames(Jan_Avg),  # old column names (years)\n                    timevar = \"year\",         # name for new column of years\n                    ids = as.numeric(rownames(Jan_Avg)),  # old row names (dates)\n                    idvar = \"dayNum\",         # name for new column of dates\n                    new.row.names = 1:217);   # renaming rows\nThere are nine arguments used in reshape(), let’s take these arguments two at a time…\n \nWe are reshaping the data frame Jan_Avg in the long direction (called melting):\ndata = Jan_Avg\ndirection=\"long\"\nnote: the other direction is “wide” (often called casting)\n \nWe are combining the temperature values in columns 1 through 7: c(1:7) and the name of the new combined column is temperatures:\nvarying = c(1:7)      # which data columns to combine\nv.name=\"temperatures\" # name of combined column\nWe are creating a new column from the seven column names in the old data frame (X2016, X2017…). The new column assigns a year to each temperature value (i.e., each row) and the new column is named years:\ntimes=colnames(Jan_Avg)   # column names (year) associated with each temp\ntimevar=\"years\"           # combined column name\nWe are also creating a new column from the 31 row names (1 through 31).  The new column assigns a date to each temperature value (i.e., each row) and the new column is named dayNum:\nids = as.numeric(rownames(Jan_Avg))   # row name (day) associated with each temp\nidvar = \"dayNum\"\nI add this argument to change the row names back to row numbers.  The line functionally does nothing but it makes the data frame easier to read in the RStudio viewer tab:\nnew.row.names = 1:217\n\n\n4.3 The reshaped data frame\nIf you open Jan_Avg_Melt (Figure 5) you will see there are 217 rows, representing the 217 daily temperatures.  On the same row as the temperature, there are columns that give the associated day and year.\n \n\nThe year changes every 31 rows so rows 1-31 are X2106, 32-62 are X21017, 63-93 are 2018, etc..\nThe dayNum cycles every 31 rows so the dayNum goes up by 1 each row and resets to 1 on rows 32, 63, 94, 125, 156, and 187.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The reshaped data frame with the year and dayNum in their own column\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4 Plotting the reshaped data frame\nWe can use one geom_line component to plot all seven years in the reshaped data frame.\n \nThe geom_line component maps:\n\nx to the temperature column\ny to the dayNum column \ncolor to the year column\n\nThe color mapping is how we create seven separate line plots – each year is placed in the legend and mapped to a different color.\n  # Plot temperature (y) ~ dayNum (x) and subset by year (color)\n  plot1 = ggplot(data = Jan_Avg_Melt) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(x=dayNum, y=temperatures, color=year));\n  plot(plot1);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: The line plots from the reshaped data frame",

    "text": "5 Create plots using for loops\nThe main reason I do not like the reshaping method is that it creates a new data frame that is less intuitive than the original.  I believe that the script should be manipulated to meet the needs of the data – not the other way around.  And we have a perfectly good programming technique to cycle through, and plot, columns in a data frame: for loops.\n \nWe can code one for loop with one geom_line that cycled through the seven columns of the original data frame to create the seven plots.\n\n5.1 Manually plotting multiple geom_lines\nWe will start by plotting three of the seven columns in Jan_Avg.  The code is similar to what we have done in previous lessons except the data frame, Jan_Avg, is not set when we initiate the canvas (i.e., not added as data in ggplot()).  Instead, we use the data frame in the mapping of the geoms.  Note: In GGPlot it is easier to use data frames in mapping when using for loops for reasons that would take us down a rabbit hole.\n  plot2 = ggplot() +                «# the data frame is not declared here»\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(x=1:31, \n                          y=«Jan_Avg»$X2016,  # the data frame is used here instead\n                          color=\"2016\")) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(x=1:31,  \n                          y=«Jan_Avg»$X2017,\n                          color=\"2017\")) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(x=1:31,\n                          y=«Jan_Avg»$X2018,\n                          color=\"2018\")) +\n    theme_bw() + \n    labs(x = \"Date\",\n         y = \"Temp (Celsius)\",\n         color = \"Year\");\n  plot(plot2);\nThere are three mapping for each geom_line:\n\nThe x mapping for each plot is 1 through 31 since we are looking at the dates from January 1st to January 31st\nThe y mapping is to the specific column of temperatures we are plotting, X2016, X2017, X2018 …\nThe color mapping is the year, which is hard coded in this example (a value instead of a variable). \n\nNote: quotes are necessary for year because year needs to be a discrete value (character), not a continuous value (numeric) – there is an application question regarding this\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Plotting 3 columns one at a time\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Generalizing the mappings: use index numbers instead of column names\nOur goal is to create code for one geom_line that can be used in a for loop to create all 7 line plots.  To do this, we need to generalize the code.\n \nIn a for loop, it is easier to index the columns by number instead of name (next lesson we will use names). \n \nInstead of using Jan_Avg$X2016, Jan_Avg$X2017, and Jan_Avg$X2018 as the y mappings, we will use the [x,y] subset notation to subset by column number instead of column name.\n \nWe provide no x value in the [x,y] subset, which means we are taking the values from every row in the column\n  plot3 = ggplot() +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(x=1:31, \n                          y=«Jan_Avg[,1]»,    # column 1, same as Jan_Avg$X2016\n                          color=\"2016\")) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(x=1:31,  \n                          y=«Jan_Avg[,2]»,    # column 2, same as Jan_Avg$X2017\n                          color=\"2017\")) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(x=1:31,\n                          y=«Jan_Avg[,3]»,    # column 3, same as Jan_Avg$X2018\n                          color=\"2018\")) +\n    theme_bw() + \n    labs(x = \"Date\",\n         y = \"Temp (Celsius)\",\n         color = \"Year\");\n  plot(plot3);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: plot3 looks exactly like plot2\n\n\n\nYou can put Jan_Avg[,2] in the Console to convince yourself that this is all values in column 2:\n&gt; Jan_Avg[,2]\n [1]  -0.4   0.4   2.5  -4.1 -10.1 -12.8 -12.8 -11.6  -6.8   0.1   2.1   0.7  -5.8\n[14]  -5.1  -4.6  -2.8   1.6   2.7   1.8   1.6   6.8   6.6   4.2   3.1   3.1   2.1  \n[27]  -0.7  -2.2  -3.0  -6.8  -3.3\n\n\n5.3 Generalize the color mappings\nThe color mapping is currently hard coded (e.g., “2016”, “2017”, etc..) – meaning color is set to a value (in quotes) instead of a variable.  We are going to change this so that the year comes from the column name.  This makes it easier to code the plot in a for loop because we can cycle through the column names using their index values:\n  plot4 = ggplot() +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(x=1:31, \n                          y=Jan_Avg[,1],  \n                          color=«colnames(Jan_Avg)[1]»)) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(x=1:31,  \n                          y=Jan_Avg[,2],  \n                          color=«colnames(Jan_Avg)[2]»)) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(x=1:31,\n                          y=Jan_Avg[,3],  \n                          color=«colnames(Jan_Avg)[3]»)) +\n    theme_bw() + \n    labs(x = \"Date\",\n         y = \"Temp (Celsius)\",\n         color = \"Year\");\n  plot(plot4);\nYou can put colnames(Jan_Avg) in the Console to convince yourself that is a vector with 7 value representing the seven column names:\n&gt; colnames(Jan_Avg)\n[1] \"X2016\" \"X2017\" \"X2018\" \"X2019\" \"X2020\" \"X2021\" \"X2022\"\nplot4 will look almost exactly like plot2 (Figure 7) – except the years in the legend are preceded with an X, something we will fix later in the lesson:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: The line plot after generalizing the y and color mappings",

    "text": "6 Using for loops and Lazy Evaluations\nWe have now generalized the script for the geom_line so that it is easier to put in a for loop.  We will now recreate the seven line plots using a for loop.\n \nWe will do this in three steps:\n\nEstablish the ggplot canvas\nAdd plots using a for loop to cycle through the columns\nAdjust the plots with theme and labs (labels)\n\n \nNote: Our first effort to use for loops will fail – in a very instructive way that introduces Lazy Evaluations, a topic that creeps up from time to time\n\n6.1 Establish the ggplot canvas\nggplot() is the function that establishes a ggplot canvas.  Effectively, what ggplot() is doing is creating a List object that holds all the plot data, information, and styling.\n \nWe start with creating a List object with nothing in it (i.e., an empty ggplot() canvas):\nplot6 = ggplot();\nA List object named plot6 has been put into the Environment and now we are going to fill it with plot data.\n\n\n6.2 Adding geoms (line plots) to the canvas\nWe want to create a line plot for all seven column in Jan_Avg.  This means we want to cycle through the seven columns using a for loop:\nfor(i in 1:7)   # cycle through columns 1-7\nAnd each time the for loop cycles we want to append one line plot to the canvas, plot6. \nIn other words, we are adding a year’s line plot to plot6 and saving the results back to plot6:\nplot6 = plot6 +\nWe need to replace the column numbers in the code from the last plot (Figure 14) with the indexing value in the for loop, i, which goes from 1 to 7:\ngeom_line(mapping=aes(x=as.numeric(rownames(Jan_Avg)), \n                      y=Jan_Avg[,«i»],                  # columns 1-7\n                      color=colnames(Jan_Avg)[«i»]));   # names from columns 1-7\nPutting all of this together we get:\n  plot6 = ggplot(); \n  \n  ### Cycle through the seven columns and make a line plot for each \n  for(i in 1:7)   # cycle through columns 1-7\n  {\n    plot6 = plot6 + \n        geom_line(mapping=aes(x=as.numeric(rownames(Jan_Avg)), \n                              y=Jan_Avg[,i], \n                              color=colnames(Jan_Avg)[i])); \n  }\n  plot(plot6);\nAnd the result is something unexpected – we only see a line plot of the last column (2022):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Only the last column was plotted – this is a case of Lazy Evaluation\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3 Lazy Evaluation \nIt looks as though only the last of the seven columns was plotted once ( Figure 10) but, actually, the last column was plotted seven times.\n \nThis happened because of the way R/GGPlot handles indexes when compiling for loops.  The compilers sees the for loop will executes seven times and stacks up the code from the seven loops like this:\n    plot6 = plot6 + \n        geom_line(mapping=aes(x=as.numeric(rownames(Jan_Avg)), \n                              y=Jan_Avg[,i], \n                              color=colnames(Jan_Avg)[i])); \n    plot6 = plot6 + \n        geom_line(mapping=aes(x=as.numeric(rownames(Jan_Avg)), \n                              y=Jan_Avg[,i], \n                              color=colnames(Jan_Avg)[i])); \n    plot6 = plot6 + \n        geom_line(mapping=aes(x=as.numeric(rownames(Jan_Avg)), \n                              y=Jan_Avg[,i], \n                              color=colnames(Jan_Avg)[i])); \n   ... (4 more) ...\nThen the compiler executed the stacked lines.  The problem is that R evaluated i after the code from the for loops was stacked.\n \nBut, after the for loop,  i is equal to 7.  So, R replace i with 7 in all seven plots in the stack.  This is called Lazy Evaluation.\nLazy Evaluation is one of the more unintuitive problems that happens a lot in programming.",

    "text": "3 Faceting\nInstead of using a mapping to add more variables to a plot, we can use a facet.  A facet uses a variable to break up the plot area by rows or columns (or both).  Let’s use a facet to add season to the temperature histogram.\n  #### Part 2: Faceting the histogram ####\n  plot2 = ggplot( data=weatherData ) +\n    geom_histogram( mapping=aes(x=avgTemp),\n                    color=\"black\") +  \n    theme_bw() +\n    «facet_grid( rows = vars(season))» +  # vars() needs to use the column\n    labs(title = \"Temperature (\\u00B0F)\",\n         subtitle = \"Lansing, Michigan: 2016\",\n         x = \"Temperature (\\u00B0F)\");     \n  plot(plot2);\nEach season now has its own row with its own temperature histogram\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Using facets to break out the seasons\n\n\n\n\n3.1 Facets are like mappings \nTo “map” a column using facet_grid, you need to put the column name as an argument in vars().  This code “maps” the season column to rows in the plotting area:\n    facet_grid( rows = vars(season) )\nfacet_grid is buggy and will not reliably use Environment variables like seasonOrdered.  The only way around all the bugs is to save Environment variables to the data frame.  We need to first save seasonOrdered as a column in weatherData before using it is a facet.\n  weatherData$seasonOrdered = seasonOrdered;\nNote: weatherData has added the column seasonOrdered to the end of the data frame.\n \nAnd then use the column seasonOrdered from the data frame.\n  #### Part 3: Reordering the seasons ####\n  plot3 = ggplot( data=weatherData ) +\n    geom_histogram( mapping=aes(x=avgTemp),\n                    color=\"black\") +  \n    theme_bw() +\n    facet_grid( rows = vars(«seasonOrdered») ) +  # column in weatherData\n    labs(title = \"Temperature (\\u00B0F)\",\n         subtitle = \"Lansing, Michigan: 2016\",\n         x = \"Temperature (\\u00B0F)\");     \n  plot(plot3);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Reordering the facets using the variable seasonOrdered\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Reversing the facet\nfacet_grid has two “mapping” subcomponents: rows and cols.  In this above case (Figure 3), seasonOrdered was mapped to row.\nWe can facet by column by mapping seasonOrdered to cols instead.\n  #### Part 4: Reversing the facet equation ####\n  plot4 = plot3 +                             # take all components from plot3\n    facet_grid( «cols» = vars(seasonOrdered) ); # and rewrite the facet component\n  plot(plot4);\nThis version is not spaced as well as the previous version.  You can change the bin sizes using the bin or binwidth components in geom_histogram.You will be using bin and binwidth in the lesson application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Switching the season facet to the x-axis\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 faceting continuous values\nfacet_grid creates a row or column for each unique value in the column you supply in vars().  If you are not careful and use a continuous column like precip2, which has 59 unique numeric values, facet_grid will attempt to make 59 columns or rows.  This will likely not work and R will either crash or time-out. \n\n\n3.4 Modifying the histogram\nLet’s make two changes to the plot:\n\nadd color by mapping the season to fill (fill is the background color)\nchange to a density plot\n\n  #### Part 5: Adding color and switching to a density plot ####\n  plot5 = ggplot( data=weatherData ) +\n    «geom_density»( mapping=aes(x=avgTemp, «fill=season»),\n                  color=\"black\") +  \n    theme_bw() +\n    facet_grid( cols=vars(seasonOrdered)) +  # season has to be in the data frame\n    labs(title = \"Temperature (\\u00B0F)\",\n         subtitle = \"Lansing, Michigan: 2016\",\n         x = \"Temperature (\\u00B0F)\");     \n  plot(plot5);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: A density plot with each facet colored using the fill mapping",

    "text": "3 Adding the year to the date values\nWe are going to create a new column in weatherData that has properly formatted date values.  Sinceit is generally not a good idea to directly modify values in a data frame, we are going to make a copy of the date column, called dateYr, and modify the dateYr column instead.\n \nThis process will be broken into four steps: \n\nSave the date column in weatherData to a vector\nAppend the year 2016 to all values in the vector\nConvert the vector into a Date vector\nSave the vector back to the data frame as the column dateYr\n\n \nNote: There are quicker ways to do this but it is important to understand the individual steps.\n\n3.1 Save the date column to a vector\nThere are multiple ways in R to save a column in a data frame to a vector.  Three ways are given below, the last two are commented out but they will produce the same results:\n#### Part 1: Add year to date values ####\n# a) save the date vector from the data frame to the variable theDate\ntheDate1 = weatherData$date;         # get all values from the dates column\n# theDate1 = weatherData[[\"date\"]];  # equivalent to previous line\\\n# theDate1 = weatherData[ , \"date\"]; # equivalent to previous 2 lines in base R\nI choose to use the first method, which uses $ to subset weatherData, for two reasons:\n\nWhen you type in $ after weatherData, RStudio will suggest a list of column names from weatherData\n$ works for both R data frames and the TidyVerse version of a dataframe called a tibble\n\nExtension: R data frames and TidyVerse tibbles\n \nIf we look at the Environment, we can see theDate1 is a character vector with 366 values:\ntheDate1 chr[1:366] \"01-01\" \"01-02\" \"01-03\" ...\nExtension: Getting a range of values in a column\n\n\n3.2 Append the year to the date\nNow we want to append, or paste,the year on to every date value in the string vector theDate1. \nWe will use paste() and there are three arguments to set:\n\nThe initial values: theDate\nThe value being appended or pasted: “-2016”\nThe separator between initial and pasted values: in this case, an empty string, “”\n\nnote: the default value for sep is a space\n\n\n# append (paste) \"-2016\" to all values in theDate1\ntheDate2 = paste(theDate1, \"-2016\", sep=\"\");\nExtension: more about paste() and the reason why argument names are not used for the first two values\n\nNow every value has a year attached to it:\n\n\n\ntheDate2    chr[1:366] \"01-01-2016\" \"01-02-2016\" \"01-03-2016\" ...\n\n\nFigure 3: Pasting the year to all values in the vector\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Convert the vector into a date vector\ntheDate2 has values that look like proper dates but R still sees the values in theDate2 as strings (or chr) not Date.\n \nTo convert the values to Date, values we need to tell R:\n\nthat the vector contains dates and\nhow the date values are formatted\n\n \nWe can do both using as.Date(), and modifying two arguments:\n\nthe object we want to convert to dates (in this case, the vector theDate2)\nthe format that the dates are in, which is: %m-%d-%y\n\n%m: 2-digit month (01 through 12)\n-: dash used to separate month from day\n%d: 2-digit date (01 through 31)\n-: dash used to separate day from year\n%Y: 4-digit year (2016) \n\nTrap: using the wrong argument for year (lowercase y vs. capital Y)\n\n\n\n# c) Save the values in Date format\ntheDate3 = as.Date(theDate2, format=\"%m-%d-%Y\");\nNow, R recognizes the values in the vector as Dates:\ntheDate3    Date[1:366] format: \"2016-01-01\" \"2016-01-02\" \"2016-01-03\" ...\nnote: The Environment always shows Date values in R’s standard date format (YYYY-DD-MM),  which is not the same as the format we used to create the date.\n\n3.3.1 Date formats and conversion specifications\nThe official term for the representation of the different parts of the Date (e.g., %m, %d, %Y)is conversion specifications, which you can find here under the details section: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/strptime.html\n \nThis includes all the different specification for time (e.g., hours, minutes), most of which are not used in this lesson.  A more concise conversion specification sheet for this lesson, which only includes specifications for dates can be found here.\n \nThe conversion specifications allow you to generalize the different components of the date – and all generalized components start with a %.  When you declare the format of a datetime string, you replace the date and time components of the string with conversion specifications.  For instance, April 15, ’22 would have the conversion specification:  “%B %d, ’%y” where:\n\n%B: Full month name\n%d: 2-digit date \n%y: 2-digit year \n\n \nThe conversion specification has the Date components (month, date, and year) and the other characters in the string (multiple spaces, comma, and apostrophe).\n \nSo, April - 15 - 22 would have the conversion specification: “%B - %d - %y”.\n \nSome other specifications:\n\n%m: Month – given as a number between 00 and 12\n%a: Abbreviated weekday (Mon, Tue, Wed…)\n%y: Last two digits of the year\n%Y: Full year\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Save the date vector to the data frame\nWe have the vector in Date format, now we need to save the values back to a new column in the data frame.  This is pretty much the reverse of the first step and, again, there are multiple ways to do it – I present three ways and comment out the last two.\n \nIn each case, we are saving theDate to the column in weatherData called dateYr:\n# d) Save theDate back to the data frame as a new column\nweatherData$dateYr = theDate3;\n# weatherData[[\"dateYr\"]] = theDate3; # equivalent to previous line\n# weatherData[, \"dateYr\"] = theDate3; # equivalent to previous 2 lines using data frames\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The data frame now has a new column, dateYr, with properly formatted dates\n\n\n\n \nWe now have a column with properly formatted date values, we can go back to plotting the data….",

This says that all geoms will use dateYr as the x mapping.  and we do not have to declare an x-mapping in the individual geoms:\n  #### Part 3: Move x to canvas --\n  ###   only works because EVERY geom uses dateYr\n  plot3= ggplot(data=weatherData, «mapping=aes(x=dateYr)») +  # x mapping here\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(y=maxTemp),     # no x mapping here  \n              color=\"violetred1\") +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(y=minTemp),     # no x mapping here\n              color=rgb(red=0.4, green=0.7, blue=0.9)) +\n    geom_smooth(mapping=aes(y=avgTemp),   # no x mapping here\n                method=\"loess\",\n                color=rgb(red=1, green=0.5, blue=0), # orange\n                linetype=4,\n                linewidth=2,\n                fill=\"lightgreen\") +\n    theme_bw() +\n    labs(title = \"Temperature throughout the year\",\n         subtitle = \"Lansing, Michigan: 2016\",\n         x = \"Day (row) number\",\n         y = \"Temperature (F)\");\n  plot(plot3);\nAnd the plot is exactly the same.  Moving the x-mapping to ggplot() works because the x-axis mapping is the same for every geom in the canvas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Moving the x-axis to the canvas does not change the plot\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Using scale component to modify date axis (proper GGPlot method)\nGGPlot, by default, displays Date values as abbreviated months and four-digit years (e.g., Jan 2016, Apr 2016) as shown in Figure 6 .\n \nIf you want to change how the dates are displayed, you need to use scale components and conversion specifications.  scale components, which we will explore much more in the next lesson, are used in GGPlot to modify the visual aspects of the axes without changing the data.  In this case, we are visually changing the way dates are displayed.\n \nThe scale component to modify date values on the x-axis is: scale_x_date\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: scale_x_date Help page – scroll down to see a description of the subcomponents\n\n\n\n \nAnd we are going to modify two subcomponents in scale_x_date:\n\ndate_breaks: The distance between axis lines – we will use 5 weeks\ndate_labels: The formatting of the date – using conversion specifications\n\n we will use abbreviated months (%b), two-digit days (%d), and two-digit years (%y) (e.g., Apr 15, ’22)\n\n\n #### Part 5: Convert date format and date breaks\n  plot5= ggplot(data=weatherData, mapping=aes(x=dateYr)) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(y=maxTemp),\n              color=\"violetred1\") +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(y=minTemp),\n              color=rgb(red=0.4, green=0.7, blue=0.9)) +\n    geom_smooth(mapping=aes(y=avgTemp),\n                method=\"loess\",\n                color=rgb(red=1, green=0.5, blue=0), # orange\n                linetype=4,\n                linewidth=2,\n                fill=\"lightgreen\") +\n    «scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"5 weeks\",»\n                «date_labels =  \"%b %d, '%y\") +  # uses conversion specifications»\n    theme_bw() +\n    labs(title = \"Temperature throughout the year\",\n         subtitle = \"Lansing, Michigan: 2016\",\n         x = \"Day (row) number\",\n         y = \"Temperature (F)\");\n  plot(plot5);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: The x-axis has formatted dates at 5-week intervals",

However, if you are developing a theme that you want to use across all of your plots, there is a good chance you want to define styles for the plots/geoms (e.g., set the default color for geom_line, set a default shape for points in a geom_point, set the background color of a geom_boxplot).\n \nChanging the default style for geoms is tricky in GGPlot because it involves changing the default behavior of GGPlot\n\n7.1 Changing geom behavior\nThe function update_geom_defaults is used to change the default style for geoms in GGPlot.\nI have created a function in ggplot_theming.r called modifyGeoms(), which calls update_geom_defaults three time to modify three different geoms (line, point, and smooth):\nmodifyGeoms = function()\n{ \n  update_geom_defaults(\"line\", list(color = \"yellow\"));\n  update_geom_defaults(\"point\", list(color = \"green\"));\n  update_geom_defaults(\"smooth\", list(color = \"red\",\n                                      linetype=4,\n                                      linewidth=2,\n                                      fill=\"lightblue\"));\n}\nupdate_geom_default needs to be called before you call ggplot().  When modifyGeoms() is called, the default color of geom_line, geom_point will be changed and the the default color, linetype, linewidth, and fill for geom_smooth will be changed.\n  #### Part 7: Include geom defaults in theme \n  «modifyGeoms();»   # function that changes the geoms\n  \n  plot7= ggplot(data=weatherData, mapping=aes(x=dateYr)) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(y=maxTemp)) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(y=minTemp)) +\n    geom_smooth(mapping=aes(y=avgTemp),\n                method=\"loess\") +\n    scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"5 weeks\",\n                 date_labels = \"%m/%d\") +\n    theme_ugly() +\n    labs(title = \"Temperature throughout the year\",\n         subtitle = \"Lansing, Michigan: 2016\",\n         x = \"Day (row) number\",\n         y = \"Temperature (F)\");\n  plot(plot7);\nAnd see the changes made by the theme and the update_geom_defaults functions in theme_UglyAdv().  We can still change the color of the lines as we did earlier (Figure 10) – all we did here was change the default color of the lines to yellow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: A plot that uses the geom and theme changes\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2 Changes to geoms are persistent\nOnce update_geom_default() is called, all subsequent ggplot() will adapt the new defaults in your R session.  This means that every subsequent GGPlot will default to yellow lines in geom_line, green points in geom_point, and four default changes in geom_smooth.\n \nFor the following code, theme_ugly() and modifyGeoms() has been removed:\n  #### Part 8: The defaults in GGPlot have been changed and will persist\n  plot8= ggplot(data=weatherData, mapping=aes(x=dateYr)) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(y=maxTemp)) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(y=minTemp)) +\n    geom_smooth(mapping=aes(y=avgTemp),\n                method=\"loess\") +\n    scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"5 weeks\",\n                 date_labels =  \"%m/%d\") +\n    labs(title = \"Temperature throughout the year\",\n         subtitle = \"Lansing, Michigan: 2016\",\n         x = \"Day (row) number\",\n         y = \"Temperature (F)\");\n  plot(plot8); \nThe theme has been removed but the changes to the geoms are still there:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: The changes to the geoms are persistent\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3 Changing back to default behavior\nThe easiest way to change back to the default geom behavior is to reload the ggplot package:\ndetach(\"package:ggplot2\", unload = TRUE);   # unloads ggplot package from session\nlibrary(package=\"ggplot2\");                 # reload package ggplot\n\nThe first line unloads the ggplot2 package from the session\nThe second line reloads the GGPlot package (effectively resetting GGPlot back to defaults).\n\n \nNow the same ggplot(): \n  plot9= ggplot(data=weatherData, mapping=aes(x=dateYr)) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(y=maxTemp)) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(y=minTemp)) +\n    geom_smooth(mapping=aes(y=avgTemp),\n                method=\"loess\") +\n    scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"5 weeks\",\n                 date_labels =  \"%m/%d\") +\n    labs(title = \"Temperature throughout the year\",\n         subtitle = \"Lansing, Michigan: 2016\",\n         x = \"Day (row) number\",\n         y = \"Temperature (F)\");\n  plot(plot9); \n…will go back to default behaviors:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: The geoms are back to their default properties",

The Application is the only product that gets evaluated. There are no tests and there is no final exam. \n\n\n3.2 Lesson feedback\nEach application has these three questions regarding the lesson:\n\nWhat was your level of comfort with the lesson/application?\nWhat areas of the lesson/application confused or still confuses you?\nWhat are some things you would like to know more about that is related to, but not covered in, this lesson?\n\n \nThese questions are vital for feedback in this class and far more useful to me than end-of-class surveys as they give me real-time information.  Please take a few minutes to answer these questions.  Feedback from these questions has become my main way of improving the class.  In return, I promise to address concerns and questions from your responses.\n\n\n3.3 Extensions and Traps\nMany of the lessons contain optional content called Extension and Traps.  Extensions contain material that goes beyond the lesson’s objectives and Traps capture some of the common issues students have with the lesson’s objectives.  There are links to Extensions and Traps within the Content area of the lesson.  Clicking on the appropriate link takes you directly to the Extension or Trap.

You can see if you have a PDF device by going to the print options in any program and see if any of the devices have “PDF” in their name (Figure 4).  If you don’t have a PDF device, then I recommend you install CutePDF (direct link to the file download).  CutePDF is simple and powerful print-to-PDF software that does not try to install any extra software on your computer. Trap: Bloatware\n\n\n\n5.5 Codeblocks\nClicking on the clipboard in the upper-right corner of the codeblock (Figure 5) will copy the code to the clipboard. You can then paste the code into RStudio (or any other text editor)\n\n\n\n# the next two lines should be at the top of all your scripts\nrm(list=ls());\noptions(show.error.locations = TRUE);\n# create three variables: d, t, and v\n# give d and t values and use them to calculate v\nd = 100;\nt = 20;\nv = d/t;\n\n\nFigure 5: Clicking on clipboard in upper-right corner selects all the text and copies it to the clipboard\n\n\n\n\n\n5.6 Special note about images in the lessons for this class\nRStudio is a rapidly evolving program, and it would be too much work to maintain all the lesson images in order to reflect the visual likeness of the newest version of RStudio.  Some of the images in this class still reflect the 2019 version of RStudio (when R was still at version 3.5). There are also minor changes that I have made to the code that I did not believe warrants putting in new images.  For instance, my RStudio Project name might change between images and some of the RStudio buttons and tabs will look slightly different (think of it as a check on how observant you are!).  I have tried to make sure these differences change nothing functionally.  Inevitably, something will fall through the cracks – so please, contact the instructor if there is something causing a problem!",

Plagiarism, cheating, and all other forms of academic dishonesty are prohibited. Students are expected to adhere to the ethical and professional standards associated with their programs and academic courses. All applicable portions of Michigan State’s Policy on Academic Integrity apply to non-credit courses. Copies of the Policy on Academic Integrity may be accessed at https://www.msu.edu/unit/ombud/honestylinks.html.\n\n\n7.3 Instructor Responsibilities\n\nInstructor will be available for assistance for requested virtual office hours (through Zoom).\nInstructor will respond to emails from students within 1 business day.  Potential for delayed responses (e.g., instructor is on vacation) will be posted on the front page of the course.\nChanges to the course will be posted in the Announcements section of the home page for the class.\n\n\n\n7.4 Attendance\nYou are expected to log in to the class at least once a week. Logging in allows you to stay updated and see new announcements.\n\n\n7.5 Participation\nPlease note that not all course lessons are the same length and the later ones tend to involve more work. Our goals with regard to participation/progress are to (a) keep you engaged in the course, (b) enhance the overall learning environment by promoting student-teacher communication, and (c) avoid a last minute time crunch for everyone involved. We will not be sympathetic or make allowances for your failure on course tasks or deadlines that result from not seeing announcements because you had not accessed the course for an extended period, and had not told us you would be away from the internet.\n\n\n7.6 ADA Statement\n\nMSU provides students with disabilities reasonable accommodations to participate in educational programs, activities, or services. Students with disabilities requiring accommodations to participate in class activities or meet course requirements should contact the instructor as early as possible.\nFor students needing accommodations for disabilities, please contact your instructor and The Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities at Michigan State University at 517-353-9642.",

    "text": "2 Viewing file extensions and hidden files\nBy default, Windows and Mac hides file extensions from you (e.g., your Word document file is listed in the file manager as stuff instead of stuff.docx).  This is not convenient when you are programming as you are working with many file types (e.g., *.txt, *.r, *.csv) and, many times, the only difference between the name of two files is the extension.  For instance, you might have two files called weather.r and weather.csv in your folder – without file extensions they are both listed as weather.\n \nAlso, when you are programming, there are files you will need to access that are hidden by default by the operating system.\n \nThis section is technically optional, but I would highly recommend you learn how to view all file extensions – it will greatly assist you when programming.\n\n2.1 Viewing in newer versions of Windows 11\nThis is easy to to do in newer versions of Windows 11:\n\nOpen the File Explorer\nClick View -&gt; Show\nCheck File name extensions and Hidden items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Change settings to view all file extensions on Windows 11\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Viewing in Windows 10 and older Windows 11 versions\nThis feature is a bit buried in these Window versions.\n \n\nOpen any File Explorer window (i.e., your folder viewer)\nIn menu bar\n\nWindows 10: click View -&gt; Options -&gt; Change folder and search options\nWindows 11: click 3 dots ( · · · ) -&gt; Options\n\nIn Folder Options window (Figure 2), go to the View tab\nUncheck Hide extensions for known file types\nCheck Show hidden files, folder, and drives\n\nNote: There is also a way to see hidden files in RStudio, which we will show later in this lesson\n\nClick OK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Viewing in older versions of Windows\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Viewing in Mac\nFile Extensions:\n\nOpen Finder\nClick on Finder -&gt; Preferences…\nIn Finder Preferences window click on the Advanced tab\nCheck Show all filename extensions\n\n \nHidden files:\n\nYou can temporarily see hidden files in the Finder by pressing Command-Shift-Dot ( . ). \nYou can use the Terminal to permanently show hidden files as described on this webpage but this is not recommended unless you are comfortable with Terminal commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Change settings to view all file extensions on a Mac",

R is a programming language and RStudio provides a structured environment for the R programming language, similar to the way Microsoft Word provides a structured environment for document editing. RStudio is patterned on other popular programming environments like Microsoft’s Visual Studio.\n \nOn Windows the default installation can be used for R and RStudio. For Mac, installation is a bit trickier – details below.\n \nNote: Even if you already have the software installed, it is a good idea to verify you have a recent version.\n\n3.1 Install or update R (need version 4.3 or higher)\nThe R for Windows download is here. Click on Download R 4.#.# for Windows.\n \nThe R for Mac download is here.  \n\nThere are two versions of R for Mac \n\nR-4.#.#-arm64.pkg: for Macs with Apple-based processors (M1, M2, M3…), all Macs from 2021 on use Apple-based processors\nR-4.#.#.pkg: for older Macs with Intel-based processors\n\nThe installer will tell you If you pick the wrong pkg file – there is no harm except a bit of wasted time.\n\n \nAnd for those of you using Linux – the R for Linux download instructions are here.\n\n\n3.2 Install or update RStudio (need version 2023.12 or higher)\nYou can download the RStudio Installer here. Download the appropriate file for your computer under Installers, open the file, and use the default installation options.\n\n3.2.1 Special instructions for Mac users\nFor Mac users there are some extra complexities:\n\nYou might be asked to install Command Line Developer Tools while installing RStudio. Go ahead and install the developer tools.\n \nThe download for RStudio is called RStudio-202X.XX.dmg.  Double-clicking the file will open the window below (Figure 4).  In the window, drag the RStudio file to the Applications folder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Opening RStudio DMG file\n\n\n\nIf you already have RStudio installed, you will be asked if you want to replace the old version – go ahead and Replace it.\n \n\nAfter installation, unmount the RStudio device in the Finder by clicking the eject button (Figure 5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Unmounting the RStudio device (very important!)",

    "text": "5 RStudio Projects and Project Folders\nMost of the work you will do in R involves multiple scripts, data files, and perhaps other types of files.  All these files together make up your project and they exist within a Project Folder, which is the folder on your computer than contains all the files and subfolders for your project – and it is very important that you keep all files associated with a project within a Project Folder.\n \nIn this class we will be using RStudio to create, edit, and execute R scripts.  In RStudio, there is a feature called RStudio Projects, which is a Project Folder, that makes it much easier to move, share, and host your project on GitHub.  You need to keep all of your class work in an RStudio Project.\n\n5.1 Create a new RStudio Project\nTo create a new RStudio Project, which is also your project folder:\n\nopen RStudio\nclick File -&gt; New Project \nIn the Create Project window click New Directory\nIn the Project Type window click New Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Creating a new RStudio Project\n\n\n\n \nIn the Create New Project window:\n\nThe Directory name is the name of the Project Folder that will contain your whole RStudio Project\nThe Project Folder will be created in the folder listed in the second textbox (Create project as subdirectory of:)\n\n \nIn Figure 8, the Project Folder named My_Project will contain the RStudio Project and is in the Desktop folder.  Note: you can name the folder whatever you want and put it in any folder location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Creating a directory for the RStudio Project\n\n\n\n \nExtension: RStudio Project in an existing directory\n\n\n5.2 RStudio Project Files Tab\nThe Files tab (bottom-right corner) in RStudio is a File Manager, and it allows you to do many things that you can do in your operating systems File Manager (called File Explorer in Windows and Finder in Mac). The Files tab can be used to open, add, remove, or rename files and folders. When we first create the RStudio Project, the Files tab will be set to the Project Folder (Figure 9, C:/Users/Charlie/Desktop/My_Project) and there is one file in the folder: My_Project.Rproj.\n \nWhenever you create an RStudio Project, an .Rproj file is added to the Project Folder. This main purpose of this file is to designate this folder as the working directory for your project.  Double-clicking on the .Rproj file will open your Project in RStudio (just like double-clicking a .docx file opens the file in Word).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Files tab opened to the Project Folder\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Viewing hidden files in RStudio\nBy default, the Files tab shows file extension but it does not show hidden files.  If you click on More -&gt; Show Hidden Files, you will see the hidden folder .Rproj.user – this is not a folder you will use in this class.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Showing hidden files\n\n\n\nExtension: *.RProj and .Rhistory\n\n\n5.4 Add Subfolders\nWe will use the Files tab in RStudio (bottom-right tab) to create two subfolders: scripts and data.\n \nTo add two folders named scripts and data:\n\nClick on New Folder in the Files tab\nEnter scripts in the textbox and click OK\nRepeat the last two steps to add a folder called data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Adding folders using the Files tab in RStudio\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5 Add files to the project\nWe are going to download two files and add them to your new RStudio Project.\n\nlesson01-Setup.r: put this file in your scripts directory\nlesson01-Setup.csv: put this file in your data directory\n\n\n\n5.6 Opening File Manager from Files tab\nThe Files tab can do a lot of things that File Explorer/Finder can do – but not everything.  For instance, you cannot drag and drop files in the Files tab like you can in File Explorer/Finder.\n \nYou can open up a File Explorer/Finder window to the same folder by clicking More… -&gt; Show Folder in New Window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: The Files tab in RStudio and the File Manager\n\n\n\n\n\n5.7 RStudio Project File Manager\nYou should now be running RStudio, opened to the RStudio Project that you just created.  If you click on the Files tab in the lower-right corner, you will see all the folders and files within your RStudio Project (linked to your Project Folder). You will also see your project name in the upper-right corner (in this case, My_Project).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: RStudio opened with an RStudio Project (named My_Project)\n\n\n\nThe *.RProj files is here and you might also see a file named .RHistory. These are not files you will need to use right away but you can learn more about them at Extension: *.RProj and .Rhistory.",

I am going to use this program to demonstrate a few of the useful buttons in RStudio.\n \nThe one button you will use most in R is Source, which executes your whole script.  Press the Source button to execute the script (Figure 16).\n \nNote: If you have already used R, there is a good chance you highlight lines of code and click Run to execute just those lines.  We are not using this method in this class.  For this class, you should always use Source to execute your code.  For more information go to Extension: Run vs. Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Running (Sourcing) the script\n\n\n\nAfter the script is run:\n\nThe Environment tab displays values for the data (variables) in the script (e.g., weatherData, windLabels).\nThe Console tab displays information about the execution of the script.\nThe Plot tab displays the box plots.  If there are multiple plots, you can use the arrow buttons to switch between the plots.\n\n\n\n6.5 Cleaning up the RStudio windows\nThere many times where you want to clean up the windows, which can get very crowded with information from old script executions.\n\nTo clean the Environment, Plot, and Console tabs use the brush button (Figure 16).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: Cleaning out the windows\n\n\n\n \nIf you click Source again, the Environment, Plot, and Console tabs will once again be populated with data from the script.",

    "text": "11 Extension: Working directories in R and RStudio (why RStudio Projects)\nThis topic is, in this author’s opinion, the most frustrating topic in R.  This is a topic that can generally be hidden from new programming students but the unique way R handles working directories makes it complex to share projects.\n \nA working directory is the folder location used when one file is looking for another file.  It is best shown by its use-case: a script file that is reading in information from another file – this file can be a data file or another script file.\n \nFor example, let’s say we have a script file called weather.r and it is pulling in data from the file weather2020.csv.  weather.r needs to first find the folder location for weather2020.csv before it can access the file.  To do this, weather.r needs a path to weather2020.csv.  This path can be thought of as map directions between two points – and the working directory is the starting point.\n \nFor the vast majority of programming languages, there is no concept of a working directory.  The process of files calling other files works like google maps – a route is specified between the two files starting with the folder the caller (e.g., weather.r) is in and ending where the callee (e.g., weather.csv) is. The path between the two files is called a relative file path. \n\n11.1 R’s default handling of working directories (it is not good…)\nIn R, the starting point, or working directory, is fixed for all R files opened in a session (called a session variable).  Using the google maps analogy, this is like saying the map starting point is fixed for everyone – it does not matter where you actually are located.  You can change the working directory in your script using setwd() but this changes the working directories for all R files in the session.  In other words, you are simply changing the starting point to a new location and all files will now use that location.\n\n\n11.2 Absolute file paths (a bad fix to the problem)\nOne way to get around working directories is to use an absolute file path.  So, instead of mapping between weather.R and weather.csv, you just give the file path for weather.csv on your computer (called the absolute file path).\n \nThis will look something like: c:\\Users\\RStudent\\Documents\\WeatherProj\\Data\\weather.csv\n \nDoing this means you do not have to worry about working directories.  But this solution breaks as soon as you move files on your computer or move them to another computer.  The reason is that the file path changes.  Absolute file paths make it almost impossible to share file and should not be used.\n\n\n11.3 How RStudio Projects handle working directory (the least-worst option)\nAn RStudio Project sets the working directory to the Project Folder.  So, for weather.r to find weather.csv inside an RStudio Project, it just needs to know where weather.csv is located relative to the project folder.  Most likely this will be something like: Data\\weather.csv. This makes it far easier to share your project because the path to weather.csv will be the same on any computer.\nWhile I believe this is by far the best method for handling working directory issues, it comes with a major caveat:You need to open script files from within the RStudio Project.  Opening the project sets the working directory for all script files used in the session.  If you a file outside of the Project session, then the working directory is not set by the project.\n\n\n11.4 The default working directory\nA working directory is not defined for a file, it is defined for a session.  So, all files within that session will have the same working directory.  IF you change the working directory in one file, you change it for every file within the session.  This leads to awkward behavior where one R file can change the behavior of another R file within the same session by using setwd().",

    "text": "14 Extension: Run vs. Source\nTechnically speaking, the difference between Run and Source is:\n\nSource will execute all the code in a script file.\nRun will execute either:\n\nThe code that is highlighted (if code is highlighted) OR\nThe command that the cursor is on (if the command is on more than one line) OR\nThe whole line the cursor is on\n\n\n \nThe real difference lies in a historical discussion of scripting vs. programming, which is a discussion beyond this class.  Suffice to say, R was originally intended to be more like an advanced calculator than a programming language. The script files would contain multiple lines of code that could be execute independently and in any order (think of these as buttons on a calculator).  The user could click a “button” to pull in data, click another “button” to run statistical analysis on the data, and click a third “button” to output the analysis.  This is what the Run button does.\n \nHowever, as R has grown, the focus has shifted towards developing well-structured code just like any modern programming language (e.g., Python, C, Java). This means executing the script as a whole instead of in parts.  This is what Source does.  Executing your script as a whole instead of in parts has many advantages as the code is easier to debug, easier to share, and much better organized – because you are forced to organize it. In the not-so-humble opinion of this author, learning to treat your script as a whole is a vital part of learning how to program.  For this reason, we will always be using the Source button in this class.",

In an RStudio Project, this is easy because the working directory is always the Project Folder of your project – and all files in the project are contained within the Project Folder.  So, you just need to look for the file relative to the Project Folder.\n \nR Programmers often get around the lack of a Project Folder/defined working directory by setting the working directory in code using setwd().  This can work locally but becomes problematic when files are shared or moved.  Whereas, RStudio Project always maintain their folder structure.",

    "text": "11 Extension: RGB Colors and Unicode Characters\nThere are many more colors than names of colors and there are many more character than keys on a keyboard.  This section will give a brief introduction on how one accesses the full spectrum of colors and characters.\n\n11.1 RGB colors\nThe are over 16 million colors we can choose from and to access all these colors, we need to use their rgb color codes.\n \nrgb stands for red, green, blue and represents the three primary light colors.  You are probably more familiar with the primary pigment colors, which are red, yellow, blue (more accurately: magenta, yellow, cyan).  The different is that primary light colors combine to make white (they are additive), whereas the primary pigment colors combine to make black/dark brown (they are subtractive).\n \nIn R, you can set color to an rgb value using the function rgb().\n \nrgb() has three arguments (red, green, blue), and each argument is set to a value from 0 (completely off) to 1 (completely on).\nSome examples:\n\nblack: rgb(red=0, green=0, blue=0)\nwhite: rgb(red=1, green=1, blue=1)\nbright blue: rgb(red=0, green=0, blue=1)\ndark blue: rgb(red=0, green=0, blue=0.3)\nyellow: rgb(red=1, green=1, blue=0)\ndark grey: rgb(red=.3, green=.3, blue=.3)\n\n \nIt takes some time to get used to mixing light colors, but it is worth it in the end to learn how to do it as you will have access to over 16 million colors.\n\n\n11.2 Unicode Characters\nUnicode characters represent the most complete digital set of characters in the world and it even includes many emojis. Wikipedia says that there are currently almost 150,000 characters (as of January 2024), and this number is growing.\n \nTo use a Unicode character, you need the Unicode number – and every character has a unique Unicode number.  Unicode numbers are hexadecimal (base-16) as opposed to the base-10 numbers you are used to.  Base-16 numbers need to use 16 character, so they use 0-9 and A-F.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Unicode characters on Wikipedia, and the hexadecimal number used to refer to them\n\n\n\n \nIn R, you can use use Unicode characters by Unicode numbers preceded by \\u.\n \nSo, Unicode character 00A2 (the cent sign) would be written as “\\u00A2”.\nUnicode characters can be directly used in a text output:\n \n&gt; cat(\"10\\u00A2\")\n10¢\nYou can add Unicode characters to any text in a plot or use Unicode as the shape of a point.\n \nWarning: no font type supports all 150,000+ Unicode characters (many are not even close).  Sticking to more common font makes it more likely that the Unicode character is available.\n\n\n11.3 Script using RGB colors and Unicode characters\nIn the following script, I used RGB colors to set the color of the points, and Unicode to represent the shape of the points.\n\nThe color rgb(red=0.7, green=0.5, blue=0) is a lot of red light, half green light, and no blue light.  It is yellowish-brown (remember these are light color, not pigment colors)\nThe shape is Unicode character 00A5, which is the Yen sign: ¥ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: Using color codes and Unicode",

    "text": "5 Changing color and size mapped properties\nNow we want to change the:\n\ncolors of the points that maps the seasonOrdered and\nthe size of the points that maps the precipitation\n\n \nFor all mapped elements, there is a scale component that can modify the properties of the mapped element.\n \nThe scale components reference page is a bit intimidating at first!\n \nMost scale components have this naming format:\n\nscale_&lt;mapped_property&gt;_&lt;type_of_values&gt;\n\n \nSo, if you want to change the color or size mapping the component will be:\n\nscale_color_&lt;type_of_values&gt;\nscale_size_&lt;type_of_values&gt;\n\n \nThe third part is a little tricky and not consistent in GGPlot:\n\ncolor is mapped to the categorical/discrete values (season) so we use scale_color_manual to change the four values\n\nnote: you can map color to a continuous value as we will see later in this lesson\n\nsize is mapped to a continuous value (precipitation), and you can use either scale_size or scale_size_continuous to change the size properties\n\nscale_size_continuous is not listed on the scale_components page, but it should be\n\n\n \nAgain, we are just going to append the new components to the last plot:\n  #### Part 4: Remapping the size and color values ####\n  plot4 = plot3 + \n    «scale_color_manual»(values=c(\"green\", \"red\", \"yellow\", \"blue\")) +\n    «scale_size_continuous»(range=c(0,5));  # could also be scale_size()\n  plot(plot4);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Changing the mapped color and size properties\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Categorical/Discrete scale components\nFor most properties mapped to discrete values, you will use one of the scale_*_manual components on this page:\nhttps://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_manual.html\n \nAll the components look pretty similar and most of the time, you are only going to change the values subcomponent:\nscale_colour_manual(\n  ...,\n  «values»,\n  aesthetics = \"colour\",\n  breaks = waiver(),\n  na.value = \"grey50\"\n)\nSo, for the color mapping, we put four colors in values to map to the four seasons:\n   scale_color_manual(values=c(\"green\", \"red\", \"yellow\", \"blue\"));\nNote: you can be more explicit and map values to color directly:\n   scale_color_manual(values=c(\"Fall\" = \"yellow\", \"Winter\" = \"blue\",\n                               \"Summer\" = \"red\", \"Spring\" = \"green\" ));\nIn the above case, the order of the seasons no longer matters – but spelling does.\n\n\n5.2 Continuous scale components\nThe scale_size or scale_size_continuous, is used to map the precipitation amounts to the size of the point, with a range of 0 to 5:\n    scale_size_continuous(range=c(0,5))\nPrecipitation goes from 0 to 1.76, so 0 maps to size=0 and 1.76 maps to size=5.\n \nBut, if you notice that even zero precipitation values, of which there are a lot, still is mapped to a very small dot on the plot (so, close to, but not quite 0).  If you really want to remove points from the plot, you need to give a negative value for the first value in the range.\n\n\n5.3 Reorder legend\nFor our last trick we will change the color and size labels in the legend and reorder the legend using theguides component so that season comes first.\n  #### Part 5: Reordering the legend and changing labels ####\n  plot5 = plot4 +\n    labs(color = \"Seasons\",\n         size = \"Precipitation\") +    \n    guides(color = guide_legend(order=1),\n           size = guide_legend(order=2));\n  plot(plot5);\nIn this case, plot4 already used a labs component that we want to add to.  So we just use labs again with the new subcomponents color and size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Redo the labs component to add color and size labels",

    "text": "3 Plotting a reshaped data frame\nSince the three line plots have similar code, it would be nice to reduce the code to one line plot that handles all three lines.\n \nThe most common way to do this is to create a reshaped data frame.  Again, this is not the method I prefer but it is the most commonly used method.\n \nIt is easier to reshape a data frame that has only the columns you need – and we only need four columns from weatherData in Figure 2  dateYr, minTemp, maxTemp, and avgTemp.  We will first create a data frame that only has these four columns:\n  partialWD = weatherData[, c(\"dateYr\", \"minTemp\",\"maxTemp\", \"avgTemp\")];\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The partial data frame with 366 rows and 4 column (1 date and 3 temperature)\n\n\n\n\n3.1 Reshaping the partial data frame\nAnd then reshape the partial data frame using reshape():\n  WD_Melt = reshape(partialWD ,         # data frame to manipulate \n              direction=\"long\",         # how to manipulate (long form)  \n              varying=c(\"minTemp\", \"maxTemp\", \"avgTemp\"), # columns to \"melt\"\n              v.name=\"temperatures\",    # name of melted column\n              times=c(\"minTemp\", \"maxTemp\", \"avgTemp\"),   # names for column\n              timevar = \"tempType\",     # name of new column with all temp names\n              ids = \"dateYr\",           # group by date\n              idvar = \"dateYr\");        # give the name dateYr to the new column\nThere are eight argument used in reshape(), let’s take these arguments two at a time:\nWe are reshaping the data frame partialWD in the long (“melted”) direction:\ndata = partialWD\ndirection=\"long\"\nWe are combining the three temperature columns, which will have 366*3 = 1098 values, and the name of the new combined column is temperatures:\nvarying=c(\"minTemp\", \"maxTemp\", \"avgTemp\")\nv.name=\"temperatures\"\nWe are creating a full column from the column names (“minTemp”, “maxTemp”, “avgTemp”), essentially exploding out the 3 column names to a column with 1098 values named tempType:\ntimes=c(\"minTemp\", \"maxTemp\", \"avgTemp\")\ntimevar=\"tempType\"\nWe are also exploding out the original 366 dateYr values to a new columns with 1098 values also named dateYr:\nid = \"dateYr\"\nidvar = \"dateYr\"\nThe new reshaped data frame with dateYr repeated 3 times and the temperature column names repeated 366 times:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The reshaped data frame has 1098 rows (366 * 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Plotting the reshaped data  frame\nWe can use one geom_line component to plot the reshaped data frame. \nThe geom_line component maps:\n\nx to the temperatures column\ny to the tempType column \ncolor to the dateYr column\n\n \nThe color mapping is how we create three separate line plots – each put into the legend and mapped to a different color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The plot from the reshaped data frame\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Using for loops to plot the columns\nAgain, I find reshaping a data frame to be an inelegant solution because it creates a new data frame that is more complex than the original.\n \nI believe it is best to maintain the original data frame when plotting.\n \nWe can plot the three columns using a for loop.  Unlike last lesson where we cycled through the the column index, this time we will cycle through the column names.  \nTo do this, we first need a vector of names to cycle through:\n  columnNames = c(\"minTemp\", \"maxTemp\", \"avgTemp\");\nThere are three values in the vector (and, hence, 3 columns to cycle through) so our for loop cycle from 1 to 3.\n  for (i in 1:3)\nAnd we are going to map:\n\nx to the dateYr column in Date form (this is true for all three cycles/plots)\ny to the column name in columnNames indexed by i\ncolor to the name of the column given by columnNames\n\n      geom_line(mapping=aes(x=as.Date(weatherData$dateYr), \n                            y=weatherData[,columnNames[!!(i)]],\n                            color=columnNames[!!(i)]));\n  plot3 = ggplot();\n  for (i in 1:3)\n  {\n    plot3 = plot3 + \n      geom_line(mapping=aes_(x=as.Date(weatherData$dateYr), \n                             y=weatherData[,columnNames[!!(i)]],\n                             color=columnNames[!!(i)]));\n  }\n  plot(plot3);\nplot3 looks exactly like the plot created using the reshaped data frame, plot2 (Figure 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Plot using for loops",

The weather events are separated by commas within the cell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: weatherType column in weatherData\n\n\n\nThe problem with the way weatherType is presented is that it makes it hard to find days with one specific weather condition (like rain, RA).  The following code will only give you the index values of days that were exclusively rainy (i.e., no other weather event except for RA):\nwhich(weatherData$weatherType == \"RA\") # find rainy days\nA common way to deal with this situation is to break the column up into multiple columns, each representing one weather condition (RA, HZ, BR, etc…).  A more robust way is to use grep() to find the codes within the column.\n\n2.1 grep() to find weather event\nWe can use grep() to find patterns within a column.  In this case, patterns that match the characters RA and BR (rainy and breezy):\n#### Part 1: using grep to find days with a specific weather event\nrainyDays = grep(weatherData$weatherType, pattern=\"RA\");   # any day with rain\nbreezyDays = grep(weatherData$weatherType, pattern=\"BR\");  # any breezy day\nrainyDays has 124 values, meaning there were 124 days with some rain (the code RA)\nbreezyDays has 172 values, meaning there were 172 days with strong winds (the code BR)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Finding the index values of the days with rain and those that were breezy\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Plotting a subset of values\nWe will now plot humidity vs temperature for only the 172 days that were breezy using breezyDays to subset of weatherData.\n \nWe usually would start the plot with:\ngg_plot_(data=weatherData)\nBut, we only want a subset of the weatherData data frame – the rows given by the values in breezyDays:\ngg_plot_(data=weatherData[breezyDays,])\nOtherwise, the plot should look familiar:\n#### Part 2: Scatter_plot_ for Humidity vs. Temperature on breezy days\n_plot_A = gg_plot_(«data=weatherData[breezyDays,]») +    # 172 days were breezy\n        geom_point(mapping=aes(x=avgTemp, y=relHum)) +\n        theme_classic() +\n        labs(title = \"Humidity vs. Temperature (Breezy Days)\",\n             subtitle = \"Lansing, Michigan: 2016\",\n             x = \"Degrees (Fahrenheit)\",\n             y = \"Relative Humidity\");\n_plot_(_plot_A);\nWe have a plot with 172 points, matching the 172 days it was breezy (or, the 172 index values in breezyDays).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Scatter_plot_ of humidity vs. temperature on breezy days",

    "text": "5 Multiple _plot_s on one canvas\nWe have not created any _plot_s yet, we have created the data for six different _plot_s.  Up until now, we have used plot() to put one plot on a canvas or we added facets to place multiple _plot_s on one axis. Now, we are going to *create a canvas with multiple _plot_s* using arrangeGrob() in the gridExtra library.\n \nThere is documentation for arrangeGrob() but it is not very intuitive – however, you should know that grob stands for graphical objects, and _plot_s are considered graphical objects.\nAlso, notice that the first argument for arrangeGrob is three dots ( … ):\narrangeGrob(«...», grobs = list(...), layout_matrix, vp = NULL,\n  name = \"arrange\", as.table = TRUE, respect = FALSE, clip = \"off\",\n  nrow = NULL, ncol = NULL, widths = NULL, heights = NULL, top = NULL,\n  bottom = NULL, left = NULL, right = NULL, padding = unit(0.5, \"line\"))\n( … ) means means that arrangePlot can take any number of plot variables – in our first example, we will be using six plot variables.\n \nWe are going to arrange the six _plot_s created above (Figure 5) on a canvas using three different methods:\n\nby rows\nby columns\ncustomized using a matrix\n\n\n5.1 Plots in rows\nThe _plot_s that will be added to the canvas must go first in arrangeGrob().  You can put as many _plot_s in as you want separated by commas.  After you put in all the plot names, you set arguments (e.g., number of rows or columns) for the canvas.\n \nFor this canvas, we set the number of rows argument, or nrow to 3.  This means arrangeGrob() will place the _plot_s listed into 3 rows (using as many columns as necessary).  Since there are six _plot_s, each of the 3 rows will have 2 _plot_s.\n#### Part 5: Arranging _plot_s on one canvas by rows\n  multi1=arrangeGrob(_plot_A, _plot_B, _plot_C, _plot_D, _plot_E, _plot_F,\n                     nrow=3);\n  _plot_(multi1);\nNote: like gg_plot_(), arrangeGrob() creates plot data.  In the above case the plot data is saved to multi1 and then plot(multi1) renders the data in the RStudio Viewer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Arranging _plot_s by rows in a canvas\n\n\n\n \nExtension: Adding labels to the grid area\n\n\n5.2 Plots in columns\nArranging _plot_s by column works almost the same way as arranging by rows except we use the argument ncol.\n \nFor this canvas we are going to put the _plot_s in the reverse order (***_plot_F, _plot_E…) and skip the last plot (_plot_A***) – so there are only five _plot_s.  Since we set ncol to 3 and there are 5 _plot_s, arrangeGrob() creates two rows but leaves an empty space at the end of the last row.\n#### Part 6: Arranging _plot_s on canvas by columns\n  multi2=arrangeGrob(_plot_F, _plot_E, _plot_D, _plot_B, _plot_A,\n                     ncol=3);\n  _plot_(multi2);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Arranging _plot_s by columns in a canvas\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Customized canvas\nThe argument in arrangeGrob() that is probably most used in layout_matrix because it allows a lot more flexibility in the plot layout.\n \nlayout_matrix is set to a 2D matrix where you can customize the placement of the _plot_s.  The rows and columns of the matrix (with their corresponding plot numbers) match the canvas layout of the _plot_s.\n \nIn the following example:\n\nAll six _plot_s are used (***_plot_A*** through ***_plot_F***)\nThe first row on the canvas will have the 4th, 5th, and 6th _plot_s (***_plot_D, _plot_E, and _plot_F***)\nThe second row on the canvas will have the 3rd, 2nd, and 1st _plot_s (***_plot_C, _plot_B, and _plot_A***)\n\n#### Part 7: Customize arrangements using matrix\n  multi3=arrangeGrob(_plot_A, _plot_B, _plot_C, _plot_D, _plot_E, _plot_F,\n                     layout_matrix = rbind(c(4,5,6),   # _plot_D, _plot_E, _plot_F\n                                           c(3,2,1))); # _plot_C, _plot_B, _plot_A\n  _plot_(multi3);\nNote: The numbers in the matrix represents the order the _plot_s are listed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: The six _plot_s using the matrix layout\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Empty spaces within the canvas\nWe can use NA to represent an empty space (i.e., no plot).\n \nThe code:\nlayout_matrix = rbind(c(NA,1,2),     # row 1: nothing, 1st _plot_, 2nd _plot_\n                      c(3,NA,NA)));  # row 2: 3rd _plot_, nothing, nothing\nTells arrangeGrob() to create a canvas that has 2 rows and 3 columns. \n\nRow 1 has nothing in the first column, the 1st plot in the second column, and the 2nd plot in the third column\nRow 2 has the 3rd plot in the first column and nothing in the second or third column\n\n \nIn the following code, **_plot_C** is the 1st plot, ***_plot_D*** is the 2nd plot, and ***_plot_E*** is the 3rd plot:\n#### Part 8: Add empty spaces to customized arrangement\n  multi4=arrangeGrob(_plot_C, _plot_D, _plot_E,\n                     layout_matrix = rbind(c(NA,1,2),   # none, _plot_C, _plot_D\n                                           c(3,NA,NA)));# _plot_E, none, none\n  _plot_(multi4);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Using layout_matrix to customize the canvas\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5 Sizing _plot_s\nWe can also use layout_matrix to resize _plot_s by extending them across rows and columns.\nThe following code makes the:\n\n1st plot 2 columns by 2 rows,\n2nd plot 1 column by 1 row\n3rd plot 2 columns by 1 row\n4th plot 1 column by 2 rows\n\nlayout_matrix = rbind(c(1,1,2),\n                      c(1,1,NA),\n                      c(4,3,3),\n                      c(4,NA,NA)));\nLet’s put the 4x3 matrix in arrangeGrob():\n#### Part 9: Extending _plot_s across rows and columns\n  multi5=arrangeGrob(_plot_A, _plot_B, _plot_C, _plot_D,\n                     layout_matrix = rbind(c(1,1,2),\n                                           c(1,1,NA),\n                                           c(4,3,3),\n                                           c(4,NA,NA)));\n  _plot_(multi5);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Extending _plot_s across rows and down columns",
