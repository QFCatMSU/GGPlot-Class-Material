The weather events are separated by commas within the cell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: weatherType column in weatherData\n\n\n\nThe problem with the way weatherType is presented is that it makes it hard to find days with one specific weather condition (like rain, RA).  The following code will only give you the index values of days that were exclusively rainy (i.e., no other weather event except for RA):\nwhich(weatherData$weatherType == \"RA\") # find rainy days\nA common way to deal with this situation is to break the column up into multiple columns, each representing one weather condition (RA, HZ, BR, etc…).  A more robust way is to use grep() to find the codes within the column.\n\n2.1 grep() to find weather event\nWe can use grep() to find patterns within a column.  In this case, patterns that match the characters RA and BR (rainy and breezy):\n#### Part 1: using grep to find days with a specific weather event\nrainyDays = grep(weatherData$weatherType, pattern=\"RA\");   # any day with rain\nbreezyDays = grep(weatherData$weatherType, pattern=\"BR\");  # any breezy day\nrainyDays has 124 values, meaning there were 124 days with some rain (the code RA)\nbreezyDays has 172 values, meaning there were 172 days with strong winds (the code BR)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Finding the index values of the days with rain and those that were breezy\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Plotting a subset of values\nWe will now plot humidity vs temperature for only the 172 days that were breezy using breezyDays to subset of weatherData.\n \nWe usually would start the plot with:\nggplot(data=weatherData)\nBut, we only want a subset of the weatherData data frame – the rows given by the values in breezyDays:\nggplot(data=weatherData[breezyDays,])\nOtherwise, the plot should look familiar:\n#### Part 2: Scatterplot for Humidity vs. Temperature on breezy days\nplotA = ggplot(«data=weatherData[breezyDays,]») +    # 172 days were breezy\n        geom_point(mapping=aes(x=avgTemp, y=relHum)) +\n        theme_classic() +\n        labs(title = \"Humidity vs. Temperature (Breezy Days)\",\n             subtitle = \"Lansing, Michigan: 2016\",\n             x = \"Degrees (Fahrenheit)\",\n             y = \"Relative Humidity\");\nplot(plotA);\nWe have a plot with 172 points, matching the 172 days it was breezy (or, the 172 index values in breezyDays).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Scatterplot of humidity vs. temperature on breezy days",

    "section": "5 Multiple plots on one canvas",
    "text": "5 Multiple plots on one canvas\nWe have not created any plots yet, we have created the data for six different plots.  Up until now, we have used plot() to put one plot on a canvas or we added facets to place multiple plots on one axis. Now, we are going to create a canvas with multiple plots using arrangeGrob() in the gridExtra library.\n \nThere is documentation for arrangeGrob() but it is not very intuitive – however, you should know that grob stands for graphical objects, and plots are considered graphical objects.\nAlso, notice that the first argument for arrangeGrob is three dots ( … ):\narrangeGrob(«...», grobs = list(...), layout_matrix, vp = NULL,\n  name = \"arrange\", as.table = TRUE, respect = FALSE, clip = \"off\",\n  nrow = NULL, ncol = NULL, widths = NULL, heights = NULL, top = NULL,\n  bottom = NULL, left = NULL, right = NULL, padding = unit(0.5, \"line\"))\n( … ) means means that arrangePlot can take any number of plot variables – in our first example, we will be using six plot variables.\n \nWe are going to arrange the six plots created above (Figure 5) on a canvas using three different methods:\n\nby rows\nby columns\ncustomized using a matrix\n\n\n5.1 Plots in rows\nThe plots that will be added to the canvas must go first in arrangeGrob().  You can put as many plots in as you want separated by commas.  After you put in all the plot names, you set arguments (e.g., number of rows or columns) for the canvas.\n \nFor this canvas, we set the number of rows argument, or nrow to 3.  This means arrangeGrob() will place the plots listed into 3 rows (using as many columns as necessary).  Since there are six plots, each of the 3 rows will have 2 plots.\n#### Part 5: Arranging plots on one canvas by rows\n  multi1=arrangeGrob(plotA, plotB, plotC, plotD, plotE, plotF,\n                     nrow=3);\n  plot(multi1);\nNote: like ggplot(), arrangeGrob() creates plot data.  In the above case the plot data is saved to multi1 and then plot(multi1) renders the data in the RStudio Viewer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Arranging plots by rows in a canvas\n\n\n\n \nExtension: Adding labels to the grid area\n\n\n5.2 Plots in columns\nArranging plots by column works almost the same way as arranging by rows except we use the argument ncol.\n \nFor this canvas we are going to put the plots in the reverse order (plotF, plotE…) and skip the last plot (plotA) – so there are only five plots.  Since we set ncol to 3 and there are 5 plots, arrangeGrob() creates two rows but leaves an empty space at the end of the last row.\n#### Part 6: Arranging plots on canvas by columns\n  multi2=arrangeGrob(plotF, plotE, plotD, plotB, plotA,\n                     ncol=3);\n  plot(multi2);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Arranging plots by columns in a canvas\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Customized canvas\nThe argument in arrangeGrob() that is probably most used in layout_matrix because it allows a lot more flexibility in the plot layout.\n \nlayout_matrix is set to a 2D matrix where you can customize the placement of the plots.  The rows and columns of the matrix (with their corresponding plot numbers) match the canvas layout of the plots.\n \nIn the following example:\n\nAll six plots are used (plotA through plotF)\nThe first row on the canvas will have the 4th, 5th, and 6th plots (plotD, plotE, and plotF)\nThe second row on the canvas will have the 3rd, 2nd, and 1st plots (plotC, plotB, and plotA)\n\n#### Part 7: Customize arrangements using matrix\n  multi3=arrangeGrob(plotA, plotB, plotC, plotD, plotE, plotF,\n                     layout_matrix = rbind(c(4,5,6),   # plotD, plotE, plotF\n                                           c(3,2,1))); # plotC, plotB, plotA\n  plot(multi3);\nNote: The numbers in the matrix represents the order the plots are listed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: The six plots using the matrix layout\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Empty spaces within the canvas\nWe can use NA to represent an empty space (i.e., no plot).\n \nThe code:\nlayout_matrix = rbind(c(NA,1,2),     # row 1: nothing, 1st plot, 2nd plot\n                      c(3,NA,NA)));  # row 2: 3rd plot, nothing, nothing\nTells arrangeGrob() to create a canvas that has 2 rows and 3 columns. \n\nRow 1 has nothing in the first column, the 1st plot in the second column, and the 2nd plot in the third column\nRow 2 has the 3rd plot in the first column and nothing in the second or third column\n\n \nIn the following code, plotC is the 1st plot, plotD is the 2nd plot, and plotE is the 3rd plot:\n#### Part 8: Add empty spaces to customized arrangement\n  multi4=arrangeGrob(plotC, plotD, plotE,\n                     layout_matrix = rbind(c(NA,1,2),   # none, plotC, plotD\n                                           c(3,NA,NA)));# plotE, none, none\n  plot(multi4);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Using layout_matrix to customize the canvas\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5 Sizing plots\nWe can also use layout_matrix to resize plots by extending them across rows and columns.\nThe following code makes the:\n\n1st plot 2 columns by 2 rows,\n2nd plot 1 column by 1 row\n3rd plot 2 columns by 1 row\n4th plot 1 column by 2 rows\n\nlayout_matrix = rbind(c(1,1,2),\n                      c(1,1,NA),\n                      c(4,3,3),\n                      c(4,NA,NA)));\nLet’s put the 4x3 matrix in arrangeGrob():\n#### Part 9: Extending plots across rows and columns\n  multi5=arrangeGrob(plotA, plotB, plotC, plotD,\n                     layout_matrix = rbind(c(1,1,2),\n                                           c(1,1,NA),\n                                           c(4,3,3),\n                                           c(4,NA,NA)));\n  plot(multi5);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Extending plots across rows and down columns",

    "text": "3 Plotting a reshaped data frame\nSince the three line plots have similar code, it would be nice to reduce the code to one line plot that handles all three lines.\n \nThe most common way to do this is to create a reshaped data frame.  Again, this is not the method I prefer but it is the most commonly used method.\n \nIt is easier to reshape a data frame that has only the columns you need – and we only need four columns from weatherData in Figure 2  dateYr, minTemp, maxTemp, and avgTemp.  We will first create a data frame that only has these four columns:\n  partialWD = weatherData[, c(\"dateYr\", \"minTemp\",\"maxTemp\", \"avgTemp\")];\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The partial data frame with 366 rows and 4 column (1 date and 3 temperature)\n\n\n\n\n3.1 Reshaping the partial data frame\nAnd then reshape the partial data frame using reshape():\n  WD_Melt = reshape(partialWD ,         # data frame to manipulate \n              direction=\"long\",         # how to manipulate (long form)  \n              varying=c(\"minTemp\", \"maxTemp\", \"avgTemp\"), # columns to \"melt\"\n              v.name=\"temperatures\",    # name of melted column\n              times=c(\"minTemp\", \"maxTemp\", \"avgTemp\"),   # names for column\n              timevar = \"tempType\",     # name of new column with all temp names\n              ids = \"dateYr\",           # group by date\n              idvar = \"dateYr\");        # give the name dateYr to the new column\nThere are eight argument used in reshape(), let’s take these arguments two at a time:\nWe are reshaping the data frame partialWD in the long (“melted”) direction:\ndata = partialWD\ndirection=\"long\"\nWe are combining the three temperature columns, which will have 366*3 = 1098 values, and the name of the new combined column is temperatures:\nvarying=c(\"minTemp\", \"maxTemp\", \"avgTemp\")\nv.name=\"temperatures\"\nWe are creating a full column from the column names (“minTemp”, “maxTemp”, “avgTemp”), essentially exploding out the 3 column names to a column with 1098 values named tempType:\ntimes=c(\"minTemp\", \"maxTemp\", \"avgTemp\")\ntimevar=\"tempType\"\nWe are also exploding out the original 366 dateYr values to a new columns with 1098 values also named dateYr:\nid = \"dateYr\"\nidvar = \"dateYr\"\nThe new reshaped data frame with dateYr repeated 3 times and the temperature column names repeated 366 times:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The reshaped data frame has 1098 rows (366 * 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Plotting the reshaped data  frame\nWe can use one geom_line component to plot the reshaped data frame. \nThe geom_line component maps:\n\nx to the temperatures column\ny to the tempType column \ncolor to the dateYr column\n\n \nThe color mapping is how we create three separate line plots – each put into the legend and mapped to a different color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The plot from the reshaped data frame\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Using for loops to plot the columns\nAgain, I find reshaping a data frame to be an inelegant solution because it creates a new data frame that is more complex than the original.\n \nI believe it is best to maintain the original data frame when plotting.\n \nWe can plot the three columns using a for loop.  Unlike last lesson where we cycled through the the column index, this time we will cycle through the column names.  \nTo do this, we first need a vector of names to cycle through:\n  columnNames = c(\"minTemp\", \"maxTemp\", \"avgTemp\");\nThere are three values in the vector (and, hence, 3 columns to cycle through) so our for loop cycle from 1 to 3.\n  for (i in 1:3)\nAnd we are going to map:\n\nx to the dateYr column in Date form (this is true for all three cycles/plots)\ny to the column name in columnNames indexed by i\ncolor to the name of the column given by columnNames\n\n      geom_line(mapping=aes(x=as.Date(weatherData$dateYr), \n                            y=weatherData[,columnNames[!!(i)]],\n                            color=columnNames[!!(i)]));\n  plot3 = ggplot();\n  for (i in 1:3)\n  {\n    plot3 = plot3 + \n      geom_line(mapping=aes_(x=as.Date(weatherData$dateYr), \n                             y=weatherData[,columnNames[!!(i)]],\n                             color=columnNames[!!(i)]));\n  }\n  plot(plot3);\nplot3 looks exactly like the plot created using the reshaped data frame, plot2 (Figure 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Plot using for loops",

The condition will be to add dates for the extreme values in the plot.\n \nThe extreme values are defined as either:\n\nhumidity above 90 or below 40\ntemperature above 80 or below 10. \n\n \nThere are four conditions here and if any of the four conditions are TRUE, then the date should be added.  This means the four conditions are ORed ( | ) together.  Let’s create an index vector for these four conditions using which():\nThere are 10 index values that meet one of the four condition given in extremePoints:\n  extremePoints = which(weatherData$relHum &gt; 90  | weatherData$relHum &lt; 40 |\n                        weatherData$avgTemp &gt; 80 | weatherData$avgTemp &lt; 10);\nAnd we will use extremePoints to subset the columns in geom_text:\n  plot9 = plot6 +\n    geom_text(mapping=aes(x=weatherData$avgTemp[extremePoints],  \n                          y=weatherData$relHum[extremePoints],\n                          label=weatherData$date[extremePoints]),\n              color = \"red\") +\n    theme_bw();\n  plot(plot9);\nAnd the ten dates are added to the points on the edge of the plot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Using which to subset the data",

Pick better value with `binwidth`.\nThis message is a bit aggressive. It says that ggplot uses 30 bins by defult and that you can change it. We will use bins and binwidth later.\n\n6.1 Mapping season to fill in the histogram\nWe can add another dimension to the histogram by mapping fill to seasonOrdered.  In geom_histogram(), fill is the background color of the bars (color is the outline color).\n \nTo change the mapped fill colors, we use scale_fill_manual, which operates just like scale_color_manual.\n \nSimilarly, changing the fill label in the legend is done by adding fill to labs():\n  #### Part 7: Mapping fill color in a histogram ####\n  plot7 = ggplot( data=weatherData ) +\n    geom_histogram( mapping=aes(x=avgTemp, «fill=seasonOrdered»),\n                    color=\"black\") +  # color is the outline color\n    theme_bw() +\n    «scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"lightgreen\", \"pink\",»     # map fill values\n                               «\"lightyellow\", \"lightblue\"))» +\n    labs(title = \"Temperature (\\u00B0F)\",\n         subtitle = \"Lansing, Michigan: 2016\",\n         x = \"Temperature (\\u00B0F)\",  \n         «fill = \"Seasons\"»);       # change the label in the legend for fill\n  plot(plot7);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: A temperature histogram with fill mapped to season\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2 Adding an outline color\nThe histogram would be a bit easier to see if we added on outline.  In a geom_histogram, color represents the outline color, and we will set it to black.\n  #### Part 8: Add outline color subcomponent to the histogram ####\n  plot8 = ggplot( data=weatherData ) +\n    geom_histogram( mapping=aes(x=avgTemp, fill=seasonOrdered),\n                    «color=\"black\"») +  # color is the outline color\n    theme_bw() +\n    scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"lightgreen\", \"pink\", \n                               \"lightyellow\", \"lightblue\")) +\n    labs(title = \"Temperature (\\u00B0F)\",\n         subtitle = \"Lansing, Michigan: 2016\",\n         x = \"Temperature (\\u00B0F)\",  \n         fill = \"Seasons\");      \n  plot(plot8);\ncolor in this plot is not mapped, color is a subcomponent of geom_histogram().  You can use color as a mapping in a histogram – that will be part of the application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Adding an outline color to the histogram\n\n\n\n \nExtension: Density Plots",

    "text": "7 Using color gradients as mapping\nAll the examples above map discrete values (e.g., the four seasons) to color.  We can also map continuous values to color – and the mapping creates a gradient of colors.\n \nIn this case we have a scatterplot where we map:\n\nx to wind speed\ny to humidity\ncolor to precipitation\n\n  #### Mapping the continuous values of precipitation to color #### \n  plot9 = ggplot( data=weatherData ) +\n    geom_point( mapping=aes(x=windSusSpeed, y=relHum, «color=precip2»)) +\n    theme_bw() +\n    labs(title = \"Humidity vs. Wind Speed\",\n         subtitle = \"Lansing, Michigan: 2016\",\n         x = \"Wind Speed (miles/hour)\",  \n         y = \"Humidity (\\u0025)\"); \n  plot(plot9);\nThe default in GGPlot is to create a gradient for the values that goes from dark blue to light blue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Mapping color to precipitation generates a gradient of colors\n\n\n\n\n7.1 Choose our own gradient colors\nA gradient from dark blue to light blue is probably not the best choice, luckily you can change this using the component scale_color_gradient.\n \nThe subcomponents are the low and high end colors of the gradient spectrum, in this case: orange and blue:\n  #### mapping precipitation to a gradient with two specified colors #### \n  plotA = plot9 + \n    scale_color_gradient(low=\"orange\", high=\"blue\");\n  plot(plotA);\nNote: orange and blue were specifically picked because they are on opposite sides of the color wheel, and colors on the opposite sides of the wheel create the most distinctive gradients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Choosing our own gradient spectrum for the mapped color\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2 Multiple colors in the gradient\nThe real problem is that over half of the precipitation values are zero – and we really want to better distinguish the precipitation values beyond zero.  So, let’s add more gradient colors using the scale_color_gradientn component.  scale_color_gradientn allows you to choose any (n)umber of gradient colors\n  #### mapping precipitation to 4 specified colors #### \n  plotB = plot9 + \n    scale_color_gradientn(colors=c(\"gray\", \"green\", \"yellow\", \"blue\")); \n  plot(plotB);\nThe colors gray and blue are at the top and bottom with green at the 1/3rd point and yellow at the 2/3rd point.  In other words, the four colors are equidistant apart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Using four gradient colors instead of two.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3 Changing the boundaries of the colors\nThe colors add more distinction but there are still too many points at the low end (i.e., the grey points).  We can change the color boundaries so that green and yellow start a lot earlier in the gradient.\n \nSince there are 4 colors and they are equidistant apart, the colors by default are at:\n\ngray: 0 – or 0%\ngreen: 0.33 – or 33%\nyellow: 0.66 – or 66%\nblue: 1 – or 100%\n\n \nWe can use the subcomponent values to change these percentages.  We will change them to:\n\ngray: 0 – or 0%    (no change)\ngreen: 0.05 – or 5%\nyellow: 0.25 – or 25%\nblue: 1 – or 100%  (no change)\n\n  #### set the boundary on the 4 colors #### \n  plotC = plot9 + \n    scale_color_gradientn(colors=c(\"gray\", \"green\", \"yellow\", \"blue\"),\n                          «values=c(0,0.05,0.25,1)»); \n  plot(plotC);\nvalues is not the same as precipitation values, values represent percentages – so the boundary for yellow is at 1.76*0.25 = 0.44.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Setting the boundaries of the gradient colors using values",

    "text": "11 Extension: RGB Colors and Unicode Characters\nThere are many more colors than names of colors and there are many more character than keys on a keyboard.  This section will give a brief introduction on how one accesses the full spectrum of colors and characters.\n\n11.1 RGB colors\nThe are over 16 million colors we can choose from and to access all these colors, we need to use their rgb color codes.\n \nrgb stands for red, green, blue and represents the three primary light colors.  You are probably more familiar with the primary pigment colors, which are red, yellow, blue (more accurately: magenta, yellow, cyan).  The different is that primary light colors combine to make white (they are additive), whereas the primary pigment colors combine to make black/dark brown (they are subtractive).\n \nIn R, you can set color to an rgb value using the function rgb().\n \nrgb() has three arguments (red, green, blue), and each argument is set to a value from 0 (completely off) to 1 (completely on).\nSome examples:\n\nblack: rgb(red=0, green=0, blue=0)\nwhite: rgb(red=1, green=1, blue=1)\nbright blue: rgb(red=0, green=0, blue=1)\ndark blue: rgb(red=0, green=0, blue=0.3)\nyellow: rgb(red=1, green=1, blue=0)\ndark grey: rgb(red=.3, green=.3, blue=.3)\n\n \nIt takes some time to get used to mixing light colors, but it is worth it in the end to learn how to do it as you will have access to over 16 million colors.\n\n\n11.2 Unicode Characters\nUnicode characters represent the most complete digital set of characters in the world and it even includes many emojis. Wikipedia says that there are currently almost 150,000 characters (as of January 2024), and this number is growing.\n \nTo use a Unicode character, you need the Unicode number – and every character has a unique Unicode number.  Unicode numbers are hexadecimal (base-16) as opposed to the base-10 numbers you are used to.  Base-16 numbers need to use 16 character, so they use 0-9 and A-F.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Unicode characters on Wikipedia, and the hexadecimal number used to refer to them\n\n\n\n \nIn R, you can use use Unicode characters by Unicode numbers preceded by \\u.\n \nSo, Unicode character 00A2 (the cent sign) would be written as “\\u00A2”.\nUnicode characters can be directly used in a text output:\n \n&gt; cat(\"10\\u00A2\")\n10¢\nYou can add Unicode characters to any text in a plot or use Unicode as the shape of a point.\n \nWarning: no font type supports all 280,000+ Unicode characters (many are not even close).  Sticking to more common font makes it more likely that the Unicode character is available.\n\n\n11.3 Script using RGB colors and Unicode characters\nIn the following script, I used RGB colors to set the color of the points, and Unicode to represent the shape of the points.\n\nThe color rgb(red=0.7, green=0.5, blue=0) is 70% of red light, half green light, and no blue light.  It is yellowish-brown (remember these are light color, not pigment colors)\nThe shape is Unicode character 00A5, which is the Yen sign: ¥ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: Using color codes and Unicode",

R does not care about spacing, but humans do. GGplot code for can quickly get unwieldy– that is why it is important to consider code spacing from the very beginning.  For this class, all components and subcomponents on a GGPlot will get their own line of code.  This makes the code easier to read and is a requirement for all the lesson applications.\n \n\n\n\n#### Boxplots of Change in Temperature vs. Wind Direction \n#           at different wind speeds (terribly spaced, but still works)\nthePlot = ggplot(data=weatherData) + geom_boxplot(mapping=aes(x=windDir,\n  y=changeMaxTemp), na.rm=TRUE, color=c(\"blue\", \n    rep(\"black\", 3), \"green\", rep(\"black\", 3),\n                 \"orange\", rep(\"black\", 3)), fill=c(rep(NA, 8), rep(\"red\", 3), NA)) +\n  theme_bw() +facet_grid(rows=.~factor(windSpeedLevel, levels=c(\"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\")),\nlabeller=as_labeller(windLabels)) +scale_x_discrete(limits=c(\"North\", \"East\", \n\"South\", \"West\")) + labs(title = \"Change in Temperature vs. Wind Direction\", subtitle =\n\"Lansing, Michigan: 2016\", x = \"Wind Direction\",\n       y = \"Degrees (Fahrenheit)\"); plot(thePlot);\n\n\nFigure 2: The same GGPlot code poorly spaced – but it works the same\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 GGPlot Functions are components\nThe components of a GGPlot are really the functions in the GGPlot package.  The subcomponents are the arguments of those functions.\n \nOne component (i.e., function) in the GGPlot package is labs(), which is the labeling component in GGPlot. labs() has multiple subcomponents (i.e., arguments) representing the different parts of the plot that can be labelled.  labs() was used in Figure 1 to add a title and subtitle and x-axis and y-axis labels.

In Figure 1, there are comments on lines 1, 2, 3, 7, 12, and 13.  These comments are colored light green but the color of the comments depends on your RStudio color scheme (Tools -&gt; Global Options -&gt; Appearance).\n \nYou are required to make use of comments for your project in this class.  Aside from being a good practice, it significantly reduces the frustration level of people who are trying to evaluate your work! Commenting also significantly reduces the frustration you will feel when trying to read your own code after an extended absence.",

When combined, Git and GitHub make a very powerful project-management system.\n \nWhile Git and GitHub are very powerful tools, they are not intuitive and there is a pretty high-barrier to getting started. This lesson is designed to allow you to do the very basics in Git and GitHub, which is all you will need for this class.",

The Application is the only product that gets evaluated. There are no tests and there is no final exam. \n\n\n3.2 Lesson feedback\nEach application has these three questions regarding the lesson:\n\nWhat was your level of comfort with the lesson/application?\nWhat areas of the lesson/application confused or still confuses you?\nWhat are some things you would like to know more about that is related to, but not covered in, this lesson?\n\n \nThese questions are vital for feedback in this class and far more useful to me than end-of-class surveys as they give me real-time information.  Please take a few minutes to answer these questions.  Feedback from these questions has become my main way of improving the class.  In return, I promise to address concerns and questions from your responses.\n\n\n3.3 Extensions and Traps\nMany of the lessons contain optional content called Extension and Traps.  Extensions contain material that goes beyond the lesson’s objectives and Traps capture some of the common issues students have with the lesson’s objectives.  There are links to Extensions and Traps within the Content area of the lesson.  Clicking on the appropriate link takes you directly to the Extension or Trap.

    "text": "5 Lesson features (technical)\nThis sections goes over some of the technological features built into the lessons.\n\n5.1 Long-click menu\nIf you long-click (hold left-button for about half a second) anywhere on any lesson page Figure 2, try it!), you are given options to:\n\nGo to Top of Page\nPrint/ Save as PDF (same as the lesson’s Print link)\nReturn to the Previous Position (only appears after you have jumped to a position on the page)\nMaximize All Images\nMinimize All Images\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The long-click menu – this view is from Firefox .\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Resizing Pictures\nMost images in the course can be resized so that the picture is out of your way when you don’t need to view it.\n \nClicking on the image toggles it between the minimized and maximized states.\nClicking and dragging on the image allows you to resize the image to any size. (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Test picture to resize (Ninh Bình, Việt Nam)\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Figures and references\nWhen you click on a figure reference (e.g., Figure 3), the caption on the figure will highlight for 2 seconds.\n \nIf the figure is not on the screen, then the page will scroll to the figure and highlight it.  For instance, clicking on Figure 1 will take you to the Zoom figure near the top of this page.  You can return to this position by long-clicking and selecting Return to the Previous Position\n\n\n5.4 Printing lessons and saving lessons to PDF\nYou can print any lesson or save it as a PDF by clicking on the Printer icon at the top of every lesson (and this syllabus).  This will bring up a print dialog (Figure 4) and you can print the lesson to a printer.  On most machines, you can also choose a PDF device as a printer – this will save the lesson as a PDF document. Trap: Bloatware\n \nIf you are saving the lesson to PDF or printing in color then I recommend you check Print background in the print options. This will help codeblocks and highlights stand out. If you are printing the lesson in grayscale then I recommend you uncheck Print background.\n \nNote: Using your browser’s print feature instead on the Print link will print out the whole webpage instead of just the lesson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: This author has two print-to-PDF devices – the Microsoft Print to PDF, which comes with Windows 10 and 11, works fine\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5 Codeblocks\nClicking on the clipboard in the upper-right corner of the codeblock (Figure 5) will copy the code to the clipboard. You can then paste the code into RStudio (or any other text editor)\n\n\n\n# the next two lines should be at the top of all your scripts\nrm(list=ls());\noptions(show.error.locations = TRUE);\n# create three variables: d, t, and v\n# give d and t values and use them to calculate v\nd = 100;\nt = 20;\nv = d/t;\n\n\nFigure 5: Clicking on clipboard in upper-right corner selects all the text and copies it to the clipboard\n\n\n\n\n\n5.6 Special note about images in the lessons for this class\nRStudio is a rapidly evolving program, and it would be too much work to maintain all the lesson images in order to reflect the visual likeness of the newest version of RStudio.  Some of the images in this class still reflect the 2019 version of RStudio (when R was still at version 3.5). There are also minor changes that I have made to the code that I did not believe warrants putting in new images.  For instance, my RStudio Project name might change between images and some of the RStudio buttons and tabs will look slightly different (think of it as a check on how observant you are!).  I have tried to make sure these differences change nothing functionally.  Inevitably, something will fall through the cracks – so please, contact the instructor if there is something causing a problem!",

R is a programming language and RStudio provides a structured environment for the R programming language, similar to the way Microsoft Word provides a structured environment for document editing. RStudio is patterned on other popular programming environments like Microsoft’s Visual Studio.\n \nOn Windows, R and RStudio installation is straightforward and you can use the default settings. For Macs the installation is a bit trickier, the details are below.\n \nNote: Even if you already have the software installed, it is a good idea to verify you have a recent version.\n\n4.1 Install or update R (need version 4.4 or higher)\nThe R for Windows download is here. Click on Download R 4.#.# for Windows.\n \nThe R for Mac download is here.  \n\nThere are two versions of R for Mac \n\nR-4.#.#-arm64.pkg: for Macs with Apple-based processors (M1, M2, M3…), all Macs from 2021 on use Apple-based processors\nR-4.#.#.pkg: for older Macs with Intel-based processors\n\nThe installer will tell you If you pick the wrong pkg file – there is no harm except a bit of wasted time.\n\n \nAnd for those of you using Linux – the R for Linux download instructions are here.\n\n\n4.2 Install or update RStudio\nIt is highly recommended that you have version 2025.04 or higher.\n \nYou can download the RStudio Installer here. Download the appropriate file for your computer under Installers, open the file, and use the default installation options.\n\n4.2.1 Special instructions for Mac users\nFor Mac users there are some extra complexities:\n\nYou might be asked to install Command Line Developer Tools while installing RStudio. Go ahead and install the developer tools.\n \nThe download for RStudio is called RStudio-202X.XX.dmg.  Double-clicking the file will open the window below (Figure 4).  In the window, drag the RStudio file to the Applications folder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Opening RStudio DMG file\n\n\n\nIf you already have RStudio installed, you will be asked if you want to replace the old version – go ahead and Replace it.\n \n\nAfter installation, unmount the RStudio device in the Finder by clicking the eject button (Figure 5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Unmounting the RStudio device (very important!)",

    "text": "6 RStudio Projects and Project Folders\nMost of the work you will do in R involves multiple scripts, data files, and perhaps other types of files.  All these files together make up your project and they exist within a Project Folder, which is the folder on your computer than contains all the files and subfolders for your project – and it is very important that you keep all files associated with a project within a Project Folder.\n \nIn this class we will be using RStudio to create, edit, and execute R scripts.  In RStudio, there is a feature called RStudio Projects, which is a Project Folder, that makes it much easier to move, share, and host your project on GitHub.  You need to keep all of your class work in an RStudio Project.\n\n6.1 Create a new RStudio Project\nTo create a new RStudio Project, which is also your project folder:\n\nopen RStudio\nclick File -&gt; New Project \nIn the Create Project window click New Directory\nIn the Project Type window click New Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Creating a new RStudio Project\n\n\n\n \nIn the Create New Project window:\n\nThe Directory name is the name of the Project Folder that will contain your whole RStudio Project\nThe Project Folder will be created in the folder listed in the second textbox (Create project as subdirectory of:)\n\n \nIn Figure 8, the Project Folder is named My_Project and is in the Desktop folder.  Note: you can name the folder whatever you want and put it in any folder location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Creating a directory for the RStudio Project\n\n\n\n \nExtension: RStudio Project in an existing directory\n\n\n6.2 RStudio Project Files Tab\nThe Files tab (bottom-right corner) in RStudio is a File Manager, and it allows you to do many things that you can do in your operating systems File Manager (called File Explorer in Windows and Finder in Mac). The Files tab can be used to open, add, remove, or rename files and folders. When we first create the RStudio Project, the Files tab will be set to the Project Folder (Figure 9, C:/Users/Charlie/Desktop/My_Project) and there is one file in the folder: My_Project.Rproj.\n \nWhenever you create an RStudio Project, an .Rproj file is added to the Project Folder. This main purpose of this file is to designate this folder as the working directory for your project.  Double-clicking on the .Rproj file in your File Manager will open your Project in RStudio (just like double-clicking a .docx file opens the file in Word).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Files tab opened to the Project Folder\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3 Viewing hidden files in RStudio\nBy default, the Files tab shows file extension but it does not show hidden files.  If you click on More -&gt; Show Hidden Files, you will see the hidden folder .Rproj.user – this is not a folder you will use in this class.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Showing hidden files\n\n\n\nExtension: *.RProj and .Rhistory\n\n\n6.4 Add Subfolders\nWe will use the Files tab in RStudio (bottom-right tab) to create two subfolders: scripts and data.\n \nTo add two folders named scripts and data:\n\nClick on New Folder in the Files tab\nEnter scripts in the textbox and click OK\nRepeat the last two steps to add a folder called data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Adding folders using the Files tab in RStudio\n\n\n\n\n\n6.5 Add files to the project\nWe are going to download two files and add them to your new RStudio Project.\n\nRSProj_Setup.r: put this file in your scripts directory\nRSProj_Setup.csv: put this file in your data directory\n\n\n\n6.6 Opening File Manager from Files tab\nThe Files tab can do a lot of things that File Explorer/Finder can do – but not everything.  For instance, you cannot drag and drop files in the Files tab like you can in File Explorer/Finder.\n \nYou can open up a File Explorer/Finder window to the same folder by clicking More… -&gt; Show Folder in New Window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: The Files tab in RStudio and the File Manager\n\n\n\n\n\n6.7 RStudio Project File Manager\nYou should now be running RStudio, opened to the RStudio Project that you just created.  If you click on the Files tab in the lower-right corner, you will see all the folders and files within your RStudio Project (linked to your Project Folder). You will also see your project name in the upper-right corner (in this case, My_Project).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: RStudio opened with an RStudio Project (named My_Project)\n\n\n\nThe *.RProj files is here and you might also see a file named .RHistory. These are not files you will need to use right away but you can learn more about them at Extension: *.RProj and .Rhistory.",

The code in this script is something you will learn as the class progresses.\n\n7.1 Open your RStudio Project\nThere are multiple ways to open an RStudio Project – three of them are:\n\nOpen your Project Folder in File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac) window and double-click the &lt;Project_Name&gt;.Rproj file\nIn RStudio, click File -&gt; Open Project… -&gt; navigate to the Project Folder and click the *&lt;Project_Name&gt;.Rproj file\nIn RStudio, click File -&gt; Recent Projects -&gt; choose the RStudio Project you just created\n\n\n\n7.2 Open a script file in your Project\nTo open the script file either:\n\nIn Files tab, go to the scripts folder and click on RSProj_Setup.R or\nIn RStudio click File -&gt; Open File -&gt; and then find  RSProj_Setup.R in the scripts folder and click Open.\n\n \nAfter opening the script file, you should see something that looks like this (Figure 14) on your screen:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Opening your first script in RStudio\n\n\n\nThe script will only execute properly if it is opened inside your RStudio Project.\n\n\n7.3 Setting up RStudio tabs for scripts\nWhen we are editing and executing an R script, we generally have the following RStudio tabs open (Figure 14):\n\nFile Editor – text viewer and editor for the opened script files (upper-left pane)\nConsole – displays information about the execution of your script file (lower-left pane)\nEnvironment – displays data points, or variables, from the execution of your script file (upper-right pane)\nFiles – the file manager (lower-right pane)\n\nAfter execution of this script, this will switch to Plots (Figure 15) – all plots created by the scrtipt are displayed here\n\n \n\nNote: the Help tab in the lower-right corner is something you might find useful. Extension: The Help Tab\n\n\n7.4 Common buttons used in RStudio\nThe script file, RSProj_Setup.r, is a fully functioning script that takes temperature and wind data from the Comma Separated Value (CSV) file, RSProj_Setup.csv, and plots out the data. I am going to use this program to demonstrate a few of the useful buttons in RStudio.\n \nThe one button you will use most in R is Source, which executes your whole script.  Press the Source button to execute the script (Figure 15).\n \nNote: If you have already used R, there is a good chance you highlight lines of code and click Run to execute just those lines. This is fine but, in this class, your code must work when executed using Source.  For more information go to Extension: Run vs. Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Executing the whole the script (Source)\n\n\n\nAfter the script is run:\n\nThe Environment tab displays values for the data (variables) in the script (e.g., weatherData, windLabels).\nThe Console tab displays information about the execution of the script.\nThe Plot tab displays the box plots. If there are multiple plots, you can use the arrow buttons to switch between the plots.\n\n\n\n7.5 Cleaning up the RStudio panes\nThere many times where you want to clean up the panes, which can get very crowded with information from old script executions.\n\nTo clean the Environment, Plot, and Console panes, use the brush button (Figure 16).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Cleaning out the panes\n\n\n\n \nIf you click Source again, the Environment, Plot, and Console tabs will once again be populated with data from the script.",

    "section": "12 Extension: Working directories in R and RStudio (why RStudio Projects)",
    "text": "12 Extension: Working directories in R and RStudio (why RStudio Projects)\nThis topic is, in this author’s opinion, one of the most frustrating topic in R.  Compared to other programming languages (e.g., C++. Python, Javascript), R handling of working directories makes it harderto share projects.\n \nA working directory is the folder location used when one file is looking for another file.  It is best shown by its use-case: a script file that is reading in information from another file – this file can be a data file or another script file.\n \nFor example, let’s say we have a script file called weather.r and it is pulling in data from the file weather2020.csv.  weather.r needs to first find the folder location for weather2020.csv before it can access the file.  To do this, weather.r needs a path to weather2020.csv.  This path can be thought of as map directions between two points – and the working directory is the starting point.\n \nFor the vast majority of programming languages, there is no concept of a working directory.  The process of files calling other files works like google maps – a route is specified between the two files starting with the folder the caller (e.g., weather.r) is in and ending where the callee (e.g., weather.csv) is. The path between the two files is called a relative file path. \n\n12.1 R’s default handling of working directories\nIn R, the starting point, or working directory, is fixed for all R files opened in a session (called a session variable).  Using the google maps analogy, this is like saying the map starting point is fixed for everyone – it does not matter where you actually are located.  You can change the working directory in your script using setwd() but this changes the working directories for all R files in the session.  In other words, you are simply changing the starting point to a new location and all files will now use that location.\n\n\n12.2 Absolute file paths (a bad fix to the problem)\nOne way to get around working directories is to use an absolute file path.  So, instead of mapping between weather.R and weather.csv, you just give the file path for weather.csv on your computer (called the absolute file path).\n \nThis will look something like: c:\\Users\\RStudent\\Documents\\WeatherProj\\Data\\weather.csv\n \nDoing this means you do not have to worry about working directories.  But this solution breaks as soon as you move files on your computer or move them to another computer.  The reason is that the file path changes.  Absolute file paths make it almost impossible to share file and should not be used.\n\n\n12.3 How RStudio Projects handle working directory (the least-worst option)\nAn RStudio Project sets the working directory to the Project Folder.  So, for weather.r to find weather.csv inside an RStudio Project, it just needs to know where weather.csv is located relative to the project folder.  Most likely this will be something like: Data\\weather.csv. This makes it far easier to share your project because the path to weather.csv will be the same on any computer.\nWhile I believe this is by far the best method for handling working directory issues, it comes with a major caveat:You need to open script files from within the RStudio Project.  Opening the project sets the working directory for all script files used in the session.  If you a file outside of the Project session, then the working directory is not set by the project.\n\n\n12.4 The default working directory\nA working directory is not defined for a file, it is defined for a session.  So, all files within that session will have the same working directory.  IF you change the working directory in one file, you change it for every file within the session.  This leads to awkward behavior where one R file can change the behavior of another R file within the same session by using setwd().",

    "text": "15 Extension: Run vs. Source\nTechnically speaking, the difference between Run and Source is:\n\nSource will execute all the code in a script file.\nRun will execute either:\n\nThe code that is highlighted (if code is highlighted) OR\nThe command that the cursor is on (if the command is on more than one line) OR\nThe whole line the cursor is on\n\n\n \nThe real difference lies in a historical discussion of scripting vs. programming, which is a discussion beyond this class.  Suffice to say, R was originally intended to be more like an advanced calculator than a programming language. The script files would contain multiple lines of code that could be execute independently and in any order (think of these as buttons on a calculator).  The user could click a “button” to pull in data, click another “button” to run statistical analysis on the data, and click a third “button” to output the analysis.  This is what the Run button does.\n \nHowever, as R has grown, the focus has shifted towards developing well-structured code just like any modern programming language (e.g., Python, C, Java). This means executing the script as a whole instead of in parts.  This is what Source does.  Executing your script as a whole instead of in parts has many advantages as the code is easier to debug, easier to share, and much better organized – because you are forced to organize it. In the not-so-humble opinion of this author, learning to treat your script as a whole is a vital part of learning how to program.  For this reason, we will always be using the Source button in this class.",

In an RStudio Project, this is easy because the working directory is always the Project Folder of your project – and all files in the project are contained within the Project Folder.  So, you just need to look for the file relative to the Project Folder.\n \nR Programmers often get around the lack of a Project Folder/defined working directory by setting the working directory in code using setwd().  This can work locally but becomes problematic when files are shared or moved.  Whereas, RStudio Project always maintain their folder structure.",

    "text": "5 Mapping color to the plot\nWe have a humidity vs. temperature plot but we might want to add more data (e.g., another dimension) to this plot, like season.  Since there are just four seasons, one way to do it is to represent each season with a different color.  The four seasons can be mapped on to the existing plot using the mapping color.\n  #### Part 3: adding color to represent season ####\n  plot3 = ggplot( data=weatherData ) +\n    geom_point( mapping=aes(x=avgTemp, y=relHum, «color=season») ) +\n    labs( title=\"Humidity vs Temperature\",\n          subtitle=\"Lansing, MI -- 2016\",\n          x = \"Average Temperatures (Fahrenheit)\",\n          y = \"Relative Humidity\") +\n    scale_x_continuous( breaks = seq(from=10, to=80, by=10) ) +\n    theme_bw() +\n    theme( axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, vjust=0.5) );\n  plot(plot3);\nNow the plot has an added dimension – point colors that represent season:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Mapping season to the color of the point in the scatterplot\n\n\n\nNote: For those of you thinking that winter is much drier than summer – you are correct. However, the plot gives relative humidity, not total moisture in the air.\n\n5.1 Legend and mapping\nWhenever you put a mapping in to GGPlot beyond x and y, GGPlot will create a legend for that mapping.  In Figure 2 the legend gives the colors for each season, and the title of the legend (season) is the column name.  Summer days (colored blue) is clearly on the high end of the temperature axis, where winter (colored purple) is on the low end.\n \nEverything in the legend can be modified, something we will do next lesson.\n\n\n5.2 Mapping color using numeric values\nseason is a string value with four discrete values, or categories: Summer, Fall, Winter, and Spring.  A small number of discrete values maps well to color.\n \nContinuous values can also be mapped to color –  GGPlot will create a gradient of colors to handle continuous values.  For instance, if we use the precip2 column, which gives precipitation in inches and goes from 0 to about 1.5, we get a default blue gradient of colors to represent the values:\n#### Part 3b: adding color to represent precipitation ####\n  plot3 = ggplot( data=weatherData ) +\n    geom_point( mapping=aes(x=avgTemp, y=relHum, «color=preicp2») ) +\n    labs( title=\"Humidity vs Temperature\",\n          subtitle=\"Lansing, MI -- 2016\",\n          x = \"Average Temperatures (Fahrenheit)\",\n          y = \"Relative Humidity\") +\n    scale_x_continuous( breaks = seq(from=10, to=80, by=10) ) +\n    theme_bw() +\n    theme( axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, vjust=0.5) );\n  plot(plot3b);\nSince most of the precip2 values are 0.1 or less, most of the points are on the dark side of the gradient.  There are only a few light blue points on the plot, represent the days with 1 inch or more or rain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Mapping a numeric value to color – this creates a gradient\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Mapping colors to numerous string values\nSometimes columns that look numeric are not treated as numeric – this is because they contain some string values.  In R, if a vector/column has one string value, the whole vector/column is treated as a string.  For instance, the precip column uses T to indicate a trace of precipitation (less than 0.01 inch).  We can see “T” values if we look at the first 10 values of precip.\n&gt; weatherData$precip[1:10]\n [1] \"0.04\" \"0.00\" \"T\"    \"T\"    \"0.00\" \"0.00\" \"0.00\" \"0.15\" \"0.53\" \"0.18\"\nIf we try to map precip to color, GGPlot treats each unique “string” value as a distinct (and discrete) value, creating a very busy legend:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Mapping a column with numerous “string” values",

    "text": "3 Adding the year to the date values\nWe are going to create a new column in weatherData that has properly formatted date values.  Since it is generally not a good idea to directly modify values in a data frame, we are going to make a copy of the date column, called dateYr, and modify the dateYr column instead.\n \nThis process will be broken into four steps: \n\nSave the date column in weatherData to a vector\nAppend the year 2016 to all values in the vector\nConvert the vector into a Date vector\nSave the vector back to the data frame as the column dateYr\n\n \nNote: There are quicker ways to do this but it is important to understand the individual steps.\n\n3.1 Save the date column to a vector\nThere are multiple ways in R to save a column in a data frame to a vector.  Three ways are given below, the last two are commented out, but they will produce the same results:\n#### Part 1: Add year to date values ####\n# a) save the date vector from the data frame to the variable theDate\ntheDate1 = weatherData$date;         # get all values from the dates column\n# theDate1 = weatherData[[\"date\"]];  # equivalent to previous line\\\n# theDate1 = weatherData[ , \"date\"]; # equivalent to previous 2 lines in base R\nI choose to use the first method, which uses $ to subset weatherData, for two reasons:\n\nWhen you type in $ after weatherData, RStudio will suggest a list of column names from weatherData\n$ works for both R data frames and the TidyVerse version of a dataframe called a tibble\n\nExtension: R data frames and TidyVerse tibbles\n \nIf we look at the Environment, we can see theDate1 is a character vector with 366 values:\ntheDate1 chr[1:366] \"01-01\" \"01-02\" \"01-03\" ...\nExtension: Getting a range of values in a column\n\n\n3.2 Append the year to the date\nNow we want to append, or paste, the year on to every date value in the string vector theDate1. \nWe will use paste() and there are three arguments to set:\n\nThe initial values: theDate\nThe value being appended or pasted: “-2016”\nThe separator between initial and pasted values: in this case, an empty string, “”\n\nnote: the default value for sep is a space\n\n\n# append (paste) \"-2016\" to all values in theDate1\ntheDate2 = paste(theDate1, \"-2016\", sep=\"\");\nExtension: more about paste() and the reason why argument names are not used for the first two values\n\nEvery value in theDate2 has a year attached to it:\n\n\n\ntheDate2    chr[1:366] \"01-01-2016\" \"01-02-2016\" \"01-03-2016\" ...\n\n\nFigure 3: Pasting the year to all values in the vector\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Convert the vector into a date vector\ntheDate2 has values that look like proper dates but R still sees the values in theDate2 as strings (or chr) not Date.\n \nTo convert the values to Date, values we need to tell R:\n\nthat the vector contains dates and\nhow the date values are formatted\n\n \nWe can do both using as.Date(), and modifying two arguments:\n\nthe object we want to convert to dates (in this case, the vector theDate2)\nthe format that the dates are in, which is: %m-%d-%y\n\n%m: 2-digit month (01 through 12)\n-: dash used to separate month from day\n%d: 2-digit date (01 through 31)\n-: dash used to separate day from year\n%Y: 4-digit year (2016) \n\nTrap: using the wrong argument for year (lowercase y vs. capital Y)\n\n\n\n# c) Save the values in Date format\ntheDate3 = as.Date(theDate2, format=\"%m-%d-%Y\");\nNow, R recognizes the values in the vector as Dates:\ntheDate3    «Date»[1:366] format: \"2016-01-01\" \"2016-01-02\" \"2016-01-03\" ...\nnote: The Environment always shows Date values in R’s standard date format (YYYY-MM-DD), which is not the same as the format we used to create the date.\n\n3.3.1 Date formats and conversion specifications\nThe official term for the representation of the different parts of the Date (e.g., %m, %d, %Y) is conversion specifications, which you can find here under the details section: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/strptime.html\n \nThis includes all the different specification for time (e.g., hours, minutes), most of which are not used in this lesson.  A more concise conversion specification sheet for this lesson, which only includes specifications for dates can be found here.\n \nThe conversion specifications allow you to generalize the different components of the date – and all generalized components start with a %.  When you declare the format of a datetime string, you replace the date and time components of the string with conversion specifications.  For instance, April 15, ’22 would have the conversion specification:  “%B %d, ’%y” where:\n\n%B: Full month name\n%d: 2-digit date \n%y: 2-digit year \n\n \nThe conversion specification has the Date components (month, date, and year) and the other characters in the string (multiple spaces, comma, and apostrophe).\n \nSo, April - 15 - 22 would have the conversion specification: “%B - %d - %y”.\n \nSome other specifications:\n\n%m: Month – given as a number between 00 and 12\n%a: Abbreviated weekday (Mon, Tue, Wed…)\n%y: Last two digits of the year\n%Y: Full year\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Save the date vector to the data frame\nWe have the vector in Date format, now we need to save the values back to a new column in the data frame.  This is pretty much the reverse of the first step and, again, there are multiple ways to do it – I present three ways and comment out the last two.\n \nIn each case, we are saving theDate to the column in weatherData called dateYr:\n# d) Save theDate back to the data frame as a new column\nweatherData$dateYr = theDate3;\n# weatherData[[\"dateYr\"]] = theDate3; # equivalent to previous line\n# weatherData[, \"dateYr\"] = theDate3; # equivalent to previous 2 lines using data frames\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The data frame now has a new column, dateYr, with properly formatted dates\n\n\n\n \nWe now have a column with properly formatted date values, we can go back to plotting the data….",

This says that all geoms will use dateYr as the x mapping, meaning we do not have to declare an x-mapping in the individual geoms:\n  #### Part 3: Move x to canvas --\n  ###   only works because EVERY geom uses dateYr\n  plot3= ggplot(data=weatherData, «mapping=aes(x=dateYr)») +  # x mapping here\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(y=maxTemp),     # no x mapping here  \n              color=\"violetred1\") +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(y=minTemp),     # no x mapping here\n              color=rgb(red=0.4, green=0.7, blue=0.9)) +\n    geom_smooth(mapping=aes(y=avgTemp),   # no x mapping here\n                method=\"loess\",\n                color=rgb(red=1, green=0.5, blue=0), # orange\n                linetype=4,\n                linewidth=2,\n                fill=\"lightgreen\") +\n    theme_bw() +\n    labs(title = \"Temperature throughout the year\",\n         subtitle = \"Lansing, Michigan: 2016\",\n         x = \"Day (row) number\",\n         y = \"Temperature (F)\");\n  plot(plot3);\nAnd the plot is exactly the same.  Moving the x-mapping to ggplot() works because the x-axis mapping is the same for every geom in the canvas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Moving the x-axis to the canvas does not change the plot\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Using scale component to modify date axis (proper GGPlot method)\nGGPlot, by default, displays Date values as abbreviated months and four-digit years (e.g., Jan 2016, Apr 2016) as shown in Figure 6 .\n \nIf you want to change how the dates are displayed, you need to use scale components and conversion specifications.  scale components, which we will explore much more in the next lesson, are used in GGPlot to modify the visual aspects of the axes without changing the data.  In this case, we are visually changing the way dates are displayed.\n \nThe scale component to modify date values on the x-axis is: scale_x_date\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: scale_x_date Help page – scroll down to see a description of the subcomponents\n\n\n\n \nAnd we are going to modify two subcomponents in scale_x_date:\n\ndate_breaks: The distance between axis lines – we will use 5 weeks\ndate_labels: The formatting of the date – using conversion specifications\n\nwe will use abbreviated months (%b), two-digit days (%d), and two-digit years (%y) (e.g., Apr 15, ’22)\n\n\n #### Part 5: Convert date format and date breaks\n  plot5= ggplot(data=weatherData, mapping=aes(x=dateYr)) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(y=maxTemp),\n              color=\"violetred1\") +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(y=minTemp),\n              color=rgb(red=0.4, green=0.7, blue=0.9)) +\n    geom_smooth(mapping=aes(y=avgTemp),\n                method=\"loess\",\n                color=rgb(red=1, green=0.5, blue=0), # orange\n                linetype=4,\n                linewidth=2,\n                fill=\"lightgreen\") +\n    «scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"5 weeks\",»\n                «date_labels =  \"%b %d, '%y\") +  # uses conversion specifications»\n    theme_bw() +\n    labs(title = \"Temperature throughout the year\",\n         subtitle = \"Lansing, Michigan: 2016\",\n         x = \"Day (row) number\",\n         y = \"Temperature (F)\");\n  plot(plot5);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: The x-axis has formatted dates at 5-week intervals",

    "section": "7 Changing styles on plots/ geoms",
    "text": "7 Changing styles on plots/ geoms\nThe function theme_ugly() returns a theme() component to the caller.\n \nThe problem is that theme() cannot be used to change styles on plots (i.e., geoms). However, if you are developing a theme that you want to use across all of your plots, there is a good chance you want to define styles for the plots/geoms (e.g., set the default color for geom_line, set a default shape for points in a geom_point, set the background color of a geom_boxplot).\n \nChanging the default style for geoms is tricky in GGPlot because it involves changing the default behavior of GGPlot\n\n7.1 Changing geom behavior\nThe function update_geom_defaults is used to change the default style for geoms in GGPlot.\nI have created a function in ggplot_theming.r called modifyGeoms(), which calls update_geom_defaults three time to modify three different geoms (line, point, and smooth):\nmodifyGeoms = function()\n{ \n  update_geom_defaults(\"line\", list(color = \"yellow\"));\n  update_geom_defaults(\"point\", list(color = \"green\"));\n  update_geom_defaults(\"smooth\", list(color = \"red\",\n                                      linetype=4,\n                                      linewidth=2,\n                                      fill=\"lightblue\"));\n}\nupdate_geom_default needs to be called before you call ggplot().  When modifyGeoms() is called, the default color of geom_line, geom_point will be changed and the the default color, linetype, linewidth, and fill for geom_smooth will be changed.\n  #### Part 7: Include geom defaults in theme \n  «modifyGeoms();»   # function that changes the geoms\n  \n  plot7= ggplot(data=weatherData, mapping=aes(x=dateYr)) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(y=maxTemp)) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(y=minTemp)) +\n    geom_smooth(mapping=aes(y=avgTemp),\n                method=\"loess\") +\n    scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"5 weeks\",\n                 date_labels = \"%m/%d\") +\n    theme_ugly() +\n    labs(title = \"Temperature throughout the year\",\n         subtitle = \"Lansing, Michigan: 2016\",\n         x = \"Day (row) number\",\n         y = \"Temperature (F)\");\n  plot(plot7);\nAnd see the changes made by the theme and the update_geom_defaults functions in theme_UglyAdv().  We can still change the color of the lines as we did earlier (Figure 10) – all we did here was change the default color of the lines to yellow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: A plot that uses the geom and theme changes\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2 Changes to geoms are persistent\nOnce update_geom_default() is called, all subsequent ggplot() will adapt the new defaults in your R session.  This means that every subsequent GGPlot will default to yellow lines in geom_line, green points in geom_point, and four default changes in geom_smooth.\n \nFor the following code, theme_ugly() and modifyGeoms() has been removed:\n  #### Part 8: The defaults in GGPlot have been changed and will persist\n  plot8= ggplot(data=weatherData, mapping=aes(x=dateYr)) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(y=maxTemp)) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(y=minTemp)) +\n    geom_smooth(mapping=aes(y=avgTemp),\n                method=\"loess\") +\n    scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"5 weeks\",\n                 date_labels =  \"%m/%d\") +\n    labs(title = \"Temperature throughout the year\",\n         subtitle = \"Lansing, Michigan: 2016\",\n         x = \"Day (row) number\",\n         y = \"Temperature (F)\");\n  plot(plot8); \nThe theme has been removed but the changes to the geoms are still there:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: The changes to the geoms are persistent\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3 Changing back to default behavior\nThere is no function that resets GGPlot to the default geom behavior. Instead you unload the GGPlot package and then reload it.\ndetach(\"package:ggplot2\", unload = TRUE);   # unloads ggplot package from session\nlibrary(package=\"ggplot2\");                 # reload package ggplot\n\nThe first line unloads the ggplot2 package from the session\nThe second line loads the GGPlot package (effectively resetting GGPlot back to defaults).\n\n \nNow the same ggplot(): \n  plot9= ggplot(data=weatherData, mapping=aes(x=dateYr)) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(y=maxTemp)) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(y=minTemp)) +\n    geom_smooth(mapping=aes(y=avgTemp),\n                method=\"loess\") +\n    scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"5 weeks\",\n                 date_labels =  \"%m/%d\") +\n    labs(title = \"Temperature throughout the year\",\n         subtitle = \"Lansing, Michigan: 2016\",\n         x = \"Day (row) number\",\n         y = \"Temperature (F)\");\n  plot(plot9); \n…will go back to default behaviors:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: The geoms are back to their default properties",

In this example, all temperature values from the seven columns go into one column.\nExpand the column names to a new column (in blue). In this example, the columns names are the years.\nExpand the row names to a new column (in green).

This is called melting a data frame.  So, the reshaped data frame will have 217 rows.\n \nThe rows and column names of the original data frame (Figure 2) have information about the date (1-31) and year (2016-2022).  We need to maintain the year and date information across every row in the reshaped data frame meaning we need to create a column for the date and the year.\n \nThe reshaped data frame will have 217 rows (31*7) and three columns: temperature, year, and date ( Figure 4 )\n\n\n4.2 Creating the reshaped data frame\nWe can use the reshape() function to create the new data frame.\n \nIn this new data frame we need to \n\ncombine the seven temperature columns into one column\nmaintain the year (original column names) and date (original row names) information in new columns\n\n  Jan_Avg_Melt = reshape(data=Jan_Avg,        # data frame to manipulate\n                    direction=\"long\",         # how to manipulate (long form) \n                    varying=c(1:7),           # columns to combine (melt)\n                    v.name=\"temperatures\",    # name of combined column\n                    times=colnames(Jan_Avg),  # old column names (years)\n                    timevar = \"year\",         # name for new column of years\n                    ids = as.numeric(rownames(Jan_Avg)),  # old row names (dates)\n                    idvar = \"dayNum\",         # name for new column of dates\n                    new.row.names = 1:217);   # renaming rows\nThere are nine arguments used in reshape(), let’s take these arguments two at a time…\n \nWe are reshaping the data frame Jan_Avg in the long direction (called melting):\ndata = Jan_Avg\ndirection=\"long\"\nnote: the other direction is “wide” (often called casting)\n \nWe are combining the temperature values in columns 1 through 7: c(1:7) and the name of the new combined column is temperatures:\nvarying = c(1:7)      # which data columns to combine\nv.name=\"temperatures\" # name of combined column\nWe are creating a new column from the seven column names in the old data frame (X2016, X2017…). The new column assigns a year to each temperature value (i.e., each row) and the new column is named years:\ntimes=colnames(Jan_Avg)   # column names (year) associated with each temp\ntimevar=\"years\"           # combined column name\nWe are also creating a new column from the 31 row names (1 through 31).  The new column assigns a date to each temperature value (i.e., each row) and the new column is named dayNum:\nids = as.numeric(rownames(Jan_Avg))   # row name (day) associated with each temp\nidvar = \"dayNum\"\nI add this argument to change the row names back to row numbers.  The line functionally does nothing but it makes the data frame easier to read in the RStudio viewer tab:\nnew.row.names = 1:217\n\n\n4.3 The reshaped data frame\nIf you open Jan_Avg_Melt (Figure 5) you will see there are 217 rows, representing the 217 daily temperatures.  On the same row as the temperature, there are columns that give the associated day and year.\n \n\nThe year changes every 31 rows so rows 1-31 are X2106, 32-62 are X21017, 63-93 are 2018, etc..\nThe dayNum cycles every 31 rows so the dayNum goes up by 1 each row and resets to 1 on rows 32, 63, 94, 125, 156, and 187.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The reshaped data frame with the year and dayNum in their own column\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4 Plotting the reshaped data frame\nWe can use one geom_line component to plot all seven years in the reshaped data frame.\n \nThe geom_line component maps:\n\nx to the temperature column\ny to the dayNum column \ncolor to the year column\n\nThe color mapping is how we create seven separate line plots – each year is placed in the legend and mapped to a different color.\n  # Plot temperature (y) ~ dayNum (x) and subset by year (color)\n  plot1 = ggplot(data = Jan_Avg_Melt) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(x=dayNum, y=temperatures, color=year));\n  plot(plot1);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: The line plots from the reshaped data frame",

    "text": "5 Create plots using for loops\nThe main reason I do not like the reshaping method is that it creates a new data frame that is less intuitive than the original.  I believe that the script should be manipulated to meet the needs of the data – not the other way around.  And we have a perfectly good programming technique to cycle through, and plot, columns in a data frame: for loops.\n \nWe can code one for loop with one geom_line that cycled through the seven columns of the original data frame to create the seven plots.\n\n5.1 Manually plotting multiple geom_lines\nWe will start by plotting three of the seven columns in Jan_Avg.  The code is similar to what we have done in previous lessons except the data frame, Jan_Avg, is not set when we initiate the canvas (i.e., not added as data in ggplot()).  Instead, we use the data frame in the mapping of the geoms.  Note: In GGPlot it is easier to use data frames in mapping when using for loops for reasons that would take us down a rabbit hole.\n  plot2 = ggplot() +                «# the data frame is not declared here»\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(x=1:31, \n                          y=«Jan_Avg»$X2016,  # the data frame is used here instead\n                          color=\"2016\")) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(x=1:31,  \n                          y=«Jan_Avg»$X2017,\n                          color=\"2017\")) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(x=1:31,\n                          y=«Jan_Avg»$X2018,\n                          color=\"2018\")) +\n    theme_bw() + \n    labs(x = \"Date\",\n         y = \"Temp (Celsius)\",\n         color = \"Year\");\n  plot(plot2);\nThere are three mapping for each geom_line:\n\nThe x mapping for each plot is 1 through 31 since we are looking at the dates from January 1st to January 31st\nThe y mapping is to the specific column of temperatures we are plotting, X2016, X2017, X2018 …\nThe color mapping is the year, which is hard coded in this example (a value instead of a variable). \n\nNote: quotes are necessary for year because year needs to be a discrete value (character), not a continuous value (numeric) – there is an application question regarding this\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Plotting 3 columns one at a time\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Generalizing the mappings: use index numbers instead of column names\nOur goal is to create code for one geom_line that can be used in a for loop to create all 7 line plots.  To do this, we need to generalize the code.\n \nIn a for loop, it is easier to index the columns by number instead of name (next lesson we will use names). \n \nInstead of using Jan_Avg$X2016, Jan_Avg$X2017, and Jan_Avg$X2018 as the y mappings, we will use the [x,y] subset notation to subset by column number instead of column name.\n \nWe provide no x value in the [x,y] subset, which means we are taking the values from every row in the column\n  plot3 = ggplot() +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(x=1:31, \n                          y=«Jan_Avg[,1]»,    # column 1, same as Jan_Avg$X2016\n                          color=\"2016\")) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(x=1:31,  \n                          y=«Jan_Avg[,2]»,    # column 2, same as Jan_Avg$X2017\n                          color=\"2017\")) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(x=1:31,\n                          y=«Jan_Avg[,3]»,    # column 3, same as Jan_Avg$X2018\n                          color=\"2018\")) +\n    theme_bw() + \n    labs(x = \"Date\",\n         y = \"Temp (Celsius)\",\n         color = \"Year\");\n  plot(plot3);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: plot3 looks exactly like plot2\n\n\n\nYou can put Jan_Avg[,2] in the Console to convince yourself that this is all values in column 2:\n&gt; Jan_Avg[,2]\n [1]  -0.4   0.4   2.5  -4.1 -10.1 -12.8 -12.8 -11.6  -6.8   0.1   2.1   0.7  -5.8\n[14]  -5.1  -4.6  -2.8   1.6   2.7   1.8   1.6   6.8   6.6   4.2   3.1   3.1   2.1  \n[27]  -0.7  -2.2  -3.0  -6.8  -3.3\n\n\n5.3 Generalize the color mappings\nThe color mapping is currently hard coded (e.g., “2016”, “2017”, etc..) – meaning color is set to a value (in quotes) instead of a variable.  We are going to change this so that the year comes from the column name.  This makes it easier to code the plot in a for loop because we can cycle through the column names using their index values:\n  plot4 = ggplot() +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(x=1:31, \n                          y=Jan_Avg[,1],  \n                          color=«colnames(Jan_Avg)[1]»)) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(x=1:31,  \n                          y=Jan_Avg[,2],  \n                          color=«colnames(Jan_Avg)[2]»)) +\n    geom_line(mapping=aes(x=1:31,\n                          y=Jan_Avg[,3],  \n                          color=«colnames(Jan_Avg)[3]»)) +\n    theme_bw() + \n    labs(x = \"Date\",\n         y = \"Temp (Celsius)\",\n         color = \"Year\");\n  plot(plot4);\nYou can put colnames(Jan_Avg) in the Console to convince yourself that is a vector with 7 value representing the seven column names:\n&gt; colnames(Jan_Avg)\n[1] \"X2016\" \"X2017\" \"X2018\" \"X2019\" \"X2020\" \"X2021\" \"X2022\"\nplot4 will look almost exactly like plot2 (Figure 7) – except the years in the legend are preceded with an X, something we will fix later in the lesson:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: The line plot after generalizing the y and color mappings",

    "text": "6 Using for loops and Lazy Evaluations\nWe have now generalized the script for the geom_line so that it is easier to put in a for loop.  We will now recreate the seven line plots using a for loop.\n \nWe will do this in three steps:\n\nEstablish the ggplot canvas\nAdd plots using a for loop to cycle through the columns\nAdjust the plots with theme and labs (labels)\n\n \nNote: Our first effort to use for loops will fail – in a very instructive way that introduces Lazy Evaluations, a topic that creeps up from time to time\n\n6.1 Establish the ggplot canvas\nggplot() is the function that establishes a ggplot canvas.  Effectively, what ggplot() is doing is creating a List object that holds all the plot data, information, and styling.\n \nWe start with creating a List object with nothing in it (i.e., an empty ggplot() canvas):\nplot6 = ggplot();\nA List object named plot6 has been put into the Environment and now we are going to fill it with plot data.\n\n\n6.2 Adding geoms (line plots) to the canvas\nWe want to create a line plot for all seven column in Jan_Avg.  This means we want to cycle through the seven columns using a for loop:\nfor(i in 1:7)   # cycle through columns 1-7\nAnd each time the for loop cycles we want to append one line plot to the canvas, plot6. \nIn other words, we are adding a year’s line plot to plot6 and saving the results back to plot6:\nplot6 = plot6 +\nWe need to replace the column numbers in the code from the last plot (Figure 14) with the indexing value in the for loop, i, which goes from 1 to 7:\ngeom_line(mapping=aes(x=as.numeric(rownames(Jan_Avg)), \n                      y=Jan_Avg[,«i»],                  # columns 1-7\n                      color=colnames(Jan_Avg)[«i»]));   # names from columns 1-7\nPutting all of this together we get:\n  plot6 = ggplot(); \n  \n  ### Cycle through the seven columns and make a line plot for each \n  for(i in 1:7)   # cycle through columns 1-7\n  {\n    plot6 = plot6 + \n        geom_line(mapping=aes(x=as.numeric(rownames(Jan_Avg)), \n                              y=Jan_Avg[,i], \n                              color=colnames(Jan_Avg)[i])); \n  }\n  plot(plot6);\nAnd the result is something unexpected – we only see a line plot of the last column (2022):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Only the last column was plotted – this is a case of Lazy Evaluation\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3 Lazy Evaluation \nIt looks as though only the last of the seven columns was plotted once ( Figure 10) but, actually, the last column was plotted seven times.\n \nThis happened because of the way R/GGPlot handles indexes when compiling for loops.  The compilers sees the for loop will executes seven times and stacks up the code from the seven loops like this:\n    plot6 = plot6 + \n        geom_line(mapping=aes(x=as.numeric(rownames(Jan_Avg)), \n                              y=Jan_Avg[,i], \n                              color=colnames(Jan_Avg)[i])); \n    plot6 = plot6 + \n        geom_line(mapping=aes(x=as.numeric(rownames(Jan_Avg)), \n                              y=Jan_Avg[,i], \n                              color=colnames(Jan_Avg)[i])); \n    plot6 = plot6 + \n        geom_line(mapping=aes(x=as.numeric(rownames(Jan_Avg)), \n                              y=Jan_Avg[,i], \n                              color=colnames(Jan_Avg)[i])); \n   ... (4 more) ...\nThen the compiler executed the stacked lines.  The problem is that R evaluated i after the code from the for loops was stacked.\n \nBut, after the for loop,  i is equal to 7.  So, R replace i with 7 in all seven plots in the stack.  This is called Lazy Evaluation.\nLazy Evaluation is one of the more unintuitive problems that happens a lot in programming.",

    "text": "9 Adding circles and ellipses\nNeither annotate nor GGPlot provides a convenient way to add circles and ellipses to a plot – we will use the ggforce package to do this.  ggforce adds two new plot components geom_circleand geom_ellipse.  Both components use subcomponents that are similar to the subcomponents used in other ggplot plotting components.\n  #### Part 15: Add a simple circle ####\n  ## The circle is skewed because the plot axes are not the same scale\n  plot14 = plot12 +\n     # coord_fixed() +  # sets axes to same scale so circle is visually a circle\n       geom_circle(mapping=aes(x0 = 50, y0 = 50, r = 10),\n                 alpha=0.2,   \n                 color = \"blue\",\n                 fill = \"green\",\n                 linewidth=3,\n                 linetype=3);\n  plot(plot15);\nThe main difference in setup between geom_circle and other plotting components is that you need to map three value: x0, y0, and r.  x0 and y0 represent the circle’s center and r represents the radius.\n \nAxes often have different scales that will skew the circle.  If you want to visually maintain the circle then you need to rescale the axes – this is done using coord_fixed(), which is commented out in my code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Adding a circle to the plot\n\n\n\n\n9.1 Ellipse\ngeom_ellipse is similar to geom_circle except that you need more values to define an ellipse.  The mapped values are:\n\nx0, y0: center point of the ellipse\na, b: the two radii of the ellipse\nangle: spins the ellipse \n\n  plot16 = plot12 + \n    geom_ellipse(mapping=aes(x0 = 50, y0 = 50, a = 20, b=10, angle=-90),\n                 alpha=0.2,   \n                 color = \"blue\",\n                 fill = \"green\",\n                 linewidth=3,\n                 linetype=3);\n  plot(plot16);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Adding an ellipse to a plot",
