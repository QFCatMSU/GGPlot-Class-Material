You can sign up for an account at <https://github.com>.\n\n## Git and GitHub\n\nFor this class, we will use Git and GitHub for your class assignments.\n\n \n\n***Git*** and ***GitHub*** are two terms that are often conflated. [Git]{.hl} is versioning software -- you use Git on your computer to document and create a history of your project folder.  Using the project history, you can bring back previous versions of files or your entire Project.  Git calls the project folder, along with its full history, a [repository]{.hl}.\n\n \n\n[GitHub]{.hl} is an online software development platform and a place to store, sync, and share your Git repository. When combined, Git and GitHub make a very powerful project-management system.\n\n \n\nWhile Git and GitHub are very powerful tools, they are not intuitive and there is a pretty high-barrier to getting started. This lesson is designed to allow you to do the very basics in Git and GitHub.\n\n## Install Git on your computer (need version 2.44 or higher)\n\nFor ***Windows***, [go here to download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) -- click on ***Download for Windows***. Git asks a lot of questions during installation and you can choose the default option for everything.\n\n \n\nFor ***Mac***, [there is no direct installation of Git]{.hl}. I recommend using **Homebrew**, which is a useful tool for any programmer using a Mac because it gives you access to a bunch of programming tools.\n\n### Homebrew installation of Git on Mac:\n\n-   Go to the [Homebrew homepage](https://brew.sh/)\n\n-   Copy the text under the heading ***Install Homebrew***\n\n-   Paste the text in a ***Terminal*** window (RStudio has a ***Terminal*** tab in the bottom-left pane)\n\n    -   Be patient -- it takes time to install!\n\n-   When Homebrew is finished installing, install ***Git*** by typing in the ***Terminal***:\n\n``` bash\nbrew install git \n```\n\n-   And then install the credential manager by typing in the Terminal:\n\n``` bash\nbrew install --cask git_crendential_manager\n```\n\n#### Alternate installation for Git on Mac\n\nIf you cannot get ***Homebrew*** to work, [other options are available here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac). ***MacPort*** is the best alternative. ***XCode*** will work but it is a huge installation (at least 20GB), and most of it is not going to be used. The ***Binary Installer*** option is too outdated.\n\n## RStudio Terminal\n\nWe will be using the ***Terminal*** tab in RStudio to setup Git and to connect your project to a repository on GitHub. The ***Terminal*** in RStudio is a tab in the lower left area in RStudio. The ***Terminal*** tab is similar to the Command Prompt in Windows or Terminal in Mac\n\n \n\nMost of the Terminal command used in this lesson will only work if you are in the correct RStudio Project. The RStudio Project name (in @fig-RStudioTermProj it is ***My_Project***) is in the upper-right corner of RStudio (circled in red).\n\n![RStudio Terminal tab (don't forget to check the Project Folder)](images/RStudioTerminalAndProject.png){#fig-RStudioTermProj .fs}\n\n## Configuring Git on your computer\n\nBefore you use Git, you first need to configure Git on your computer with your GitHub username and email (i.e., the email you use to sign up for your GitHub account). The username and email are used by Git to identify who made what changes in the project history – this is especially important when you are collaborating on a project.\n\n \n\n[Git will not check if you put in a wrong or invalid username or email]{.hl}.\n\n### Adding the username and email\n\nWe will use the RStudio ***Terminal*** tab to enter these values.\n\n \n\nThe first command sets the user name in Git (replace ***userName*** with your GitHub ID):\n\n``` {.bash tab=\"Terminal\"}\ngit config --global user.name \"userName\"\n```\n\nThe second command sets the user ***email*** in Git (replace ***email*** with the email you used to signup for GitHub):\n\n``` {.bash tab=\"Terminal\"}\ngit config --global user.email \"email\"\n```\n\n![Changing Git username and email using the Terminal tab](images/GH_EmailAndUsername.png){#fig-terminalTab .fs}\n\n### Viewing the configured values\n\nYou can check if you successfully changed the username and email by executing these lines in the ***Terminal*** tab:\n\n``` {.bash tab=\"Terminal\"}\ngit config user.name \ngit config user.email\n```\n\nAfter executing the two above command, [your **Terminal** tab should look similar]{.hl} to this:\n\n::: {#fig-testGitConfig}\n``` {.bash tab=\"Terminal\"}\n$ git config user.name \nbelinskyc  \n$ git config user.email \nbelinsky@msu.edu\n```\n\nTesting the git configuration using the RStudio Terminal tab\n:::\n\n## Add Git Repository to your RStudio Project folder\n\nBoth RStudio Projects and Git Repositories are set up in your Project Folder (i.e., the root folder for your project).\n\n \n\n**To add a Git repository to your Project Folder**\n\n1.  Make sure your RStudio Project is open\n\n    -   Look for your Project name in the upper-right corner (In @fig-RStudioTermProj it is ***My_Project***)\n\n2.  Type `git init -b main` in the Terminal\n\n    -   This command ***init***ializes ***git*** and sets the initial ***b***ranch name to ***main***\n    -   You should get a message in the Terminal like:\n        -   `Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/Charlie/...`\n\n3.  Restart RStudio\n\n### RStudio Git tab\n\nAfter you add Git to an RStudio Project folder, a ***Git*** tab will appear in the upper-right window. This tab is RStudio's built-in Git interface and it can handle many commonly performed Git functions, including most of the things needed for class. It is not necessary to use the ***Git*** tab.\n\n![The Git tab has been added to the RStudio Project](images/GH_02_GitTab.png){#fig-GitTab .fs}\n\n## Create a GitHub repository\n\nA [GitHub repository]{.hl} is an online storage location that syncs with the Git repository (Project Folder) on your computer.\n\n \n\nTo create a GitHub repository (@fig-GitURL)\n\n1.  Log in to GitHub\n2.  Click on the ***+*** at the top-right and choose ***New Repository***\n3.  Choose a repository name (any name you want -- just remember you are sharing it!)\n4.  Choose whether you want the repository to be **Public** or **Private** (this can be changed later)\n    -   ***Public*** means that anyone with the repository link can view (but not edit) your files\n\n    -   ***Private*** means that only users you add in ***Settings -\\> Manage Access*** can view the repository\n5.  Click ***Create Repository***\n\n![Creating a new repository on GitHub](images/GH_CreateRepo.png){#fig-GitURL .fs}\n\n### Get the GitHub URL\n\nTo link the Git repository on your computer with this GitHub repository, you will need the URL for the GitHub repository. After you create the new repository, a window will appear ( @fig-GitHubURL) with the URL at the top in the ***Quick Setup*** section. [Copy this URL and save it]{.hl}-- you will use it in the next section.\n\n![The URL of your GitHub repository](images/GH_RepoUrl.png){#fig-GitHubURL .fs}\n\nThe GitHub repository link is the URL that takes you directly to the online project.  A GitHub repository link is always in this format:\n\n`https://github.com/<github_user_name>/<github_repository_name>.git`**\\\n**\n\nSo, if my GitHub username is ***QFCatMSU*** and my repository name is ***gitHubTest*** then the link is:\n\n`https://github.com/qfcatmsu/githubtest.git`\n\n[Note: capital/lowercase does not matter and .git is optional]{.note}\n\n \n\nIf you lose the ***Quick Setup*** page then the URL is going to be the part of the URL for your repository circled in @fig-GitHubURL\n\n### Inviting the instructor to your repository\n\nTo invite a user (or, as GitHub calls them, ***collaborator***) to your repository:\n\n1.  Go to the GitHub home page for your repository and click ***Settings***\n\n2.  Click ***Collaborators***\n\n3.  Click ***Add people***\n\n    -   You can use either the person's GitHub ID or their email address associated with their GitHub ID\n\n    -   invite your instructor: ***belinsky\\@msu.edu*** or ***belinskyc***\n\n![Inviting a user to your GitHub Repository](images/GH_AddUser.png){#fig-invite .fs}\n\n## Linking your Git repository to a GitHub repository\n\nIn this section we are going to link your Git repository, which is in the same folder as your RStudio Project, with your GitHub Repository.  The GitHub repository will become the online version of your Git repository. \n\n[Warning: This only works if the GitHub repository is empty .]{.hl}\n\n \n\nType the line below into the ***Terminal***. Replace the URL with the URL for your GitHub repository. Make sure your are in your RStudio Project.\n\n``` bash\ngit remote add origin \"https://github.com/myUserName/myRepository.git\"\n```\n\n[Note: In Windows, **Control-V** does not paste in a Terminal window, but **right-click** -\\> **Paste** works]{.note}\n\n### If you added the wrong repository name...\n\nThen you first need to remove the current GitHub repository (i.e., the ***origin***):\n\n``` bash\ngit remote rm origin\n```\n\nand then repeat this line (using the correct GitHub URL)\n\n``` bash\ngit remote add origin \"https://github.com/myUserName/myRepository.git\"\n```\n\n## Uploading to the GitHub repository\n\nGit/GitHub is asynchronous. [Changes to your local project are not automatically uploaded to GitHub]{.hl} – you need to explicitly upload the changes.\n\n \n\nTo upload your changes to GitHub, in the ***Terminal*** type:\n\n``` bash\ngit add -A\ngit commit -m \"A message about the changes to your project\"\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\nYou will repeat these lines every time you turn in an application.\n\n-   The first line compiles all the changes you have made to your project\n\n-   The second line accepts, and adds a message about, your changes\n\n-   The third line sends the changes with the message to GitHub.\n\n    -   After the first push, the third line can be reduced to `git push`\n\n \n\n[Note: you can also use the Git tab as shown in [Extension: Use Git Tab]]{.note}\n\n### Authenticating with GitHub\n\nGitHub will ask for authentication [the first time you connect to a GitHub repository]{.hl} on a computer:\n\n![GitHub asking for authentication](images/GitHubLogin-new.png){#fig-GitHubAuth .fs}\n\nWhen you click ***Sign in with your browser***, your default browser will open to the GitHub login page.\n\n \n\nAfter you login you will get an Authentication Successful window:\n\n![The Authentication Successful window](images/GH_Repo_AuthSuccess.jpg){#fig-authSuccess .fs}\n\n## Verifying the change on GitHub\n\nLet's go to your GitHub account to verify that the project files are there (@fig-GitHubPostCommit):\n\n1.  Log in to GitHub\n\n2.  On the left side, there is a section called ***Repositories***. \n\n3.  Click on the repository called ***\\<your-user-name\\>***/**\\<your-repository-name\\>**\n\n4.  Choose the ***Code*** tab (you are probably already on it)\n\n \n\nYou should notice that the files changed in the newest Commit have your Commit message attached (my Commit message: \"A message about...\") and the last commit for these files is recent (in this case: 9 minutes). \n\n![GitHub after a new Commit was pushed](images/GH_First%20Push.png){#fig-GitHubPostCommit .fs}\n\n## Application\n\nA\\) Append to the top of your ***app01.r*** the [Questions to answer] for this lesson.\n\nB\\) Send the change to GitHub by executing these lines in the ***Terminal***:\n\n``` bash\ngit add -A\ngit commit -m \"Finished lesson 1b application\"\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\n[Note: after the first push, the third line can be reduced to `git push`]{.note}\n\n \n\nAlternatively, you can use the Git tab: [Extension: Use Git Tab]\n\n \n\n::: {#Issues}\nC\\) Inform your instructor the application is done by creating an Issue in the Github repostiory:\n:::\n\n1.

What are some things you would like to know more about that is related to, but not covered in, this lesson?\n\n## Extension: Use Git Tab\n\nThe ***Git*** tab can be used to sync changes from your Project Folder to your GitHub repository.\n\n1.  In the ***Git*** tab, click ***Commit*** and the ***RStudio Review Changes*** window appears\n\n2.  On the left, check the files you want to sync with your GitHub repository (you do not have to check all of them)\n\n3.  On the right side, put a message in that describes the changes\n\n4.
