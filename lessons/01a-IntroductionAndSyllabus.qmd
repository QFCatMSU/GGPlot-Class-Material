## Welcome to Graphing with GGPlot

The purpose of this class is to introduce students to the graphing package in R called GGPlot2 and the modularization techniques used by GGPlot2 to create plots.  GGPlot2, developed by Hadley Wickham, is a powerful data visualization tool used to make publication-quality plots and it has one of the largest, and most active, R communities.  GGPlot2 differs from other graphing packages by separating a plot into its component parts, making the code for the plot more reusable and extensible.

 

This class uses RStudio and is designed for students who have at least a basic background in programming -- the equivalent of one semester of R, or any similar programming language (e.g., Visual Basic, JavaScript, C++) and familiarity with R.

 

Graphing with GGPlot is a self-paced and asynchronous online class. The amount of material in the class is about the same as a 1.5 credit, one semester class and students are expected to complete the class within three months.  There are no regularly scheduled office hours but you can email the instructor anytime to ask questions or set up a Zoom meeting.  All contacts will receive a response within one business day.

**About me...**

I started my career as a Software Engineer for Motorola in Arizona where I developed software for military radios. From there I became a high school teacher in Port Huron, MI where I taught Computer Science, Web Design, and Physical Science. After that, I worked as an Instructional Designer for the College of Education at MSU where my main project was developing the hybrid graduate program. I currently work at the QFC where my primary job is developing and teaching online classes, including this one.  In my free time you will often find me with a backpack deep in a forest or, as my picture testifies to, hanging out in the West Rim of Zion National Park.

### Technical Support

You can contact me, Charlie, regarding technical issues.

## Class Requirements

Students should be familiar with basic programming structures covered in a typical first semester programming class: ***if...else***, ***for()***, and ***functions***.  All material for this course is online -- no textbooks are required.

### Tech requirements

**Hardware:**  Any Windows (10 or 11), Mac, or Linux machine from the past ten years that has updates installed can handle all hardware and software requirements of this class.

 

**Browser:** You can use any browser (Firefox, Microsoft's Edge, Chrome, Safari) updated within the last couple of years.

 

**Videoconferencing**: We use [Zoom](http://zoom.us) for our videoconference meetings.  The meeting link will be emailed to you prior to the meeting.  It is recommended that you download and test your camera and microphone on Zoom before attending an instructor meeting.  The easiest way to do this is to go to the [Zoom test page](https://zoom.us/test).  [Note: Zoom's test page will download Zoom for you.]{.note}

 

[To test your hardware in Zoom]{.hl}, open Zoom and make sure you are on the ***Home*** tab and click the ***Settings Icon*** (@fig-zoomImg) and the **Settings** Window will open @fig-zoomImg.  Go to the ***Audio*** and ***Video*** tabs to test your microphone, speakers, and webcam.  If you are using a Mac, the view is different but the buttons are the same.

### Accessing the class

You need a [GitHub ID](http://github.com) to access the class and hand in assignments. Go to [http://github.com](http://github.com/) and click ***Sign up***, you can use a free GitHub account or a professional account.

## Class Structure

The course has 12 lessons:

1.  **RStudio Projects and GGPlot Setup**: Set up software and the programming environment for the class, go over the programming environment

2.  **Components**: Getting data from a CSV file, scatterplots, breaking down GGPlot components

3.  **Mapping and Aesthetics:** code spacing, mapping data to different aspects of a plot (size, color, shape), adding legends

4.  **Elements and Styles**: modifying plot and canvas components, RGB colors and Unicode

5.  **Date Objects and Theming**: proper formatting and converting of Date objects, creating your own GGPlot theme

6.  **Modifying Mapped Elements**: changing the properties of data elements on a plot, color gradients

7.  **Faceting**: break up plot data horizontally and vertically

8.  **Boxplot**: mapping data to a boxplot, faceting boxplots, outliers

9.  **Reshaping and For Loops 1**: two different methods for mapping data from a complex data frame

10. **Reshaping and For Loops 2**: methods for plotting subset data within a data frame, text plots

11. **Annotations**: adding non-data elements to your plot (e.g., text, points, lines)

12. **Multipaneling**: arranging and customizing plots on a canvas, regular expression

### Lesson Application

All lessons have an ***Application*** section at the end that will ask you to apply what you learned in the lesson in your own script. [The Application is the only product that gets evaluated.]{.hl} There are no tests and there is no final exam. 

### Lesson feedback

Each application has these three questions regarding the lesson:

1.  What was your level of comfort with the lesson/application?

2.  What areas of the lesson/application confused or still confuses you?

3.  What are some things you would like to know more about that is related to, but not covered in, this lesson?

 

These questions are vital for feedback in this class and far more useful to me than end-of-class surveys as they give me real-time information.  [Please take a few minutes to answer these questions.]{.hl}  Feedback from these questions has become my main way of improving the class.  In return, I promise to address concerns and questions from your responses.

### Extensions and Traps

Many of the lessons contain optional content called ***Extension*** and ***Traps***.  Extensions contain material that goes beyond the lesson's objectives and Traps capture some of the common issues students have with the lesson's objectives.  There are links to ***Extensions*** and ***Traps*** within the Content area of the lesson.  Clicking on the appropriate link takes you directly to the ***Extension*** or ***Trap.*** [Extension: Testing the extension link]

## Student-Instructor Meetings

Student-instructor meetings will be done on an as-needed basis and meetings can always be requested by the student.  Meetings are preferably over Zoom so that screens can be shared.

## Lesson features (technical)

This sections goes over some of the technological features built into the lessons.

### Long-click menu

If you long-click (hold left-button for about half a second) anywhere on any lesson page @fig-shortcutMenu, try it!), you are given options to:

-   Go to Top of Page

-   Print/ Save as PDF (same as the lesson's ***Print*** link)

-   Return to the Previous Position (only appears after you have jumped to a position on the page)

-   Maximize All Images

-   Minimize All Images

 

![The long-click menu -- this view is from Firefox .](images/Long_Click_Menu.png){#fig-shortcutMenu .fs}

### Resizing Pictures

Most images in the course can be resized so that the picture is out of your way when you don't need to view it.

 

Clicking on the image toggles it between the minimized and maximized states.

Clicking and dragging on the image allows you to resize the image to any size. (@fig-NinhBinh).

![Test picture to resize (Ninh Bình, Việt Nam)](images/NinhBinh%20(Large).jpg){#fig-NinhBinh .fs}

### Figures and references

When you click on a figure reference (e.g., @fig-NinhBinh), the caption on the figure will highlight for 2 seconds.

 

If the figure is not on the screen, then the page will scroll to the figure and highlight it.  For instance, clicking on @fig-zoomImg will take you to the Zoom figure near the top of this page.  You can return to this position by long-clicking and selecting ***Return to the Previous Position***

### Printing lessons and saving lessons to PDF

You can print any lesson or save it as a PDF by clicking on the ***Printer** icon* at the top of every lesson (and this syllabus).  This will bring up a print dialog ([Figure 4](https://qfcatmsu.github.io/FundProgUsingR/lessons/0-01-IntroductionAndSyllabus.html#fig-printPDF)) and you can print the lesson to a printer.  On most machines, you can also choose a PDF device as a printer – this will save the lesson as a PDF document. [Trap: Bloatware](https://qfcatmsu.github.io/FundProgUsingR/lessons/0-01-IntroductionAndSyllabus.html#trap-bloatware)

 

If you are saving the lesson to PDF or printing in color then I recommend you check ***Print background*** in the print options. This will help codeblocks and highlights stand out. If you are printing the lesson in grayscale then I recommend you uncheck ***Print background***.

 

[Note: Using your browser's print feature instead on the ***Print*** link will print out the whole webpage instead of just the lesson.]{.note}

![This author has two print-to-PDF devices -- the Microsoft Print to PDF, which comes with Windows 10 and 11, works fine](images/R-00-PDFPrinter.PNG){#fig-printPDF .fs}

### Codeblocks

Clicking on the clipboard in the upper-right corner of the codeblock (@fig-codeBlock) will copy the code to the clipboard. You can then paste the code into RStudio (or any other text editor)

::: {#fig-codeBlock}
``` r
# the next two lines should be at the top of all your scripts
rm(list=ls());
options(show.error.locations = TRUE);
# create three variables: d, t, and v
# give d and t values and use them to calculate v
d = 100;
t = 20;
v = d/t;
```

Clicking on clipboard in upper-right corner selects all the text and copies it to the clipboard
:::

### Special note about images in the lessons for this class

RStudio is a rapidly evolving program, and it would be too much work to maintain all the lesson images in order to reflect the visual likeness of the newest version of RStudio.  Some of the images in this class still reflect the 2019 version of RStudio (when R was still at version 3.5). There are also minor changes that I have made to the code that I did not believe warrants putting in new images.  For instance, my RStudio Project name might change between images and some of the RStudio buttons and tabs will look slightly different (think of it as a check on how observant you are!).  I have tried to make sure these differences change nothing functionally.  Inevitably, something will fall through the cracks -- so please, contact the instructor if there is something causing a problem!

## Personal statement from Charlie

The biggest thing that is lost when you move a class from a face-to-face environment to an online environment is the daily interaction between the instructor and the students.  These interactions provide invaluable informal feedback for the instructor and, I would argue, are the main tool that an instructor uses to make improvements to their class.  It is impossible to replicate this in an online class but I ask that you help me out and make an effort to communicate to me the little things.  This could mean technical nags like content not appearing properly or pages loading too slowly, lesson content that is unclear, grammar and spelling issues, or scripts that does not work or work in a way that you do not understand.

 

Thank you for reading and taking this into consideration.  In the end, it is the interactions between an instructor and the students that make a class great.

 

Now on to the stuff I have to put in a syllabus...

## Trap: Bloatware

Adobe Acrobat, like most free software you download, attempts to bundle itself with software you most likely do not need nor want (i.e., bloatware).  Make sure you take some time to read the optional offers whenever you download software. This author would argue that the main reason computers "slow" down over time is because of extra software that users unwittingly install.

 

![Three offers from Adobe that you neither need nor want -- this author recommends you uncheck them all.](images/R-00-Bloatware.PNG){#fig-bloatware .fs}
