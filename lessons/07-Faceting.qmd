### To-do

-   fix application

## Purpose

-   Break up (facet) a plot by rows and column

-   create a two-dimensional facet

### Code for the lesson

[Script for this lesson](../scripts/lesson07-Faceting.R)

-   Save the R file, called ***lesson07-FacetingAndBoxplots.R*** to the ***scripts*** folder inside your RStudio Project

[The data for this lesson (Lansing weather in 2016) is here](../Data/Lansing2016NOAA.csv) (same as previous lessons)

-   Save the CSV file, called ***Lansing2016Data.csv*** to the ***data*** folder inside your RStudio Project.

## Factoring data

Let's start with the stacked histogram from last lesson where we mapped ***x*** to temperature and ***fill*** to ***season*** -- so, a temperature histogram with seasons stacked:

``` r
  #### Part 1: Factoring the values in season ####
  seasonOrdered = factor(weatherData$season,
                         levels=c("Spring", "Summer", "Fall", "Winter"));
 
  #### Histogram with factored seasons ####
  plot1 = ggplot( data=weatherData ) +
    geom_histogram( mapping=aes(x=avgTemp, fill=seasonOrdered),
                    color="black") +  # outline color -- not mapped
    theme_bw() +
    scale_fill_manual(values=c("lightgreen", "pink", 
                               "lightyellow", "lightblue")) +
    labs(title = "Temperature (\u00B0F)",
         subtitle = "Lansing, Michigan: 2016",
         x = "Temperature (\u00B0F)",  
         fill = "Seasons");     
  plot(plot1);
```

... and the resulting stacked histogram

![A stacked histogram that maps temperature to the x-axis and seasons to the fill color](images/GGP1-06-StackedHistogram.png){#fig-stackedHist .fs}

### Mapping columns and Environment variables

If we look at the first two lines of plot1:

``` r
  plot1 = ggplot( data=«weatherData» ) +
    geom_histogram( mapping=aes(x=«avgTemp», fill=«seasonOrdered»),
```

We are creating a canvas area with the data frame ***weatherData***.  For the histogram we are mapping the ***avgTemp*** column in ***weatherData*** to the ***x***-axis and we are mapping the vector ***seasonOrdered*** to the ***fill*** (i.e., background color).

 

In a ***mapping***, GGPlot will first check the data frame initialized in the canvas to see if there is a column with the name mapped and ***avgTemp*** is a column in ***weatherData***.

 

If there is no column in the data frame with the name mapped then GGPlot will check the ***Environment***.  In the ***fill*** mapping, ***seasonOrdered*** is not a column in ***weatherData*** but ***seasonOrdered*** is a variable in the ***Environment***.

## Faceting

Instead of using a mapping to add more variables to a plot, we can use a facet.  A *facet* uses a variable to break up the plot area by rows or columns (or both).  Let's use a facet to add ***season*** to the temperature histogram.

``` r
  #### Part 2: Faceting the histogram ####
  plot2 = ggplot( data=weatherData ) +
    geom_histogram( mapping=aes(x=avgTemp),
                    color="black") +  
    theme_bw() +
    «facet_grid( rows = vars(season))» +  # vars() needs to use the column
    labs(title = "Temperature (\u00B0F)",
         subtitle = "Lansing, Michigan: 2016",
         x = "Temperature (\u00B0F)");     
  plot(plot2);
```

Each season now has its own row with its own temperature histogram

![Using facets to break out the seasons](images/GGP-1-06-Faceting-01.png){#fig-facets .fs}

### Facets are like mappings 

To "map" a column using ***facet_grid***, you need to put the column name as an argument in ***vars()***.  This code "maps" the ***season*** column to rows in the plotting area:

``` r
    facet_grid( rows = vars(season) )
```

***facet_grid*** is buggy and will not reliably use ***Environment*** variables like ***seasonOrdered***.  The only way around all the bugs is to save ***Environment*** variables to the data frame.  We need to first save ***seasonOrdered*** as a column in ***weatherData*** before using it is a facet.

``` r
  weatherData$seasonOrdered = seasonOrdered;
```

[Note: **weatherData** has added the column **seasonOrdered** to the end of the data frame.]{.note}

 

And then use the column ***seasonOrdered*** from the data frame.

``` r
  #### Part 3: Reordering the seasons ####
  plot3 = ggplot( data=weatherData ) +
    geom_histogram( mapping=aes(x=avgTemp),
                    color="black") +  
    theme_bw() +
    facet_grid( rows = vars(«seasonOrdered») ) +  # column in weatherData
    labs(title = "Temperature (\u00B0F)",
         subtitle = "Lansing, Michigan: 2016",
         x = "Temperature (\u00B0F)");     
  plot(plot3);
```

![Reordering the facets using the variable seasonOrdered](images/GGP-1-06-ordered-facet.png){#fig-orderedFacets .fs}

### Reversing the facet

***facet_grid*** has two "mapping" subcomponents: **rows** and **cols**.  In this above case (@fig-orderedFacets), ***seasonOrdered*** was mapped to ***row***.

We can facet by column by mapping ***seasonOrdered*** to ***cols*** instead.

``` r
  #### Part 4: Reversing the facet equation ####
  plot4 = plot3 +                             # take all components from plot3
    facet_grid( «cols» = vars(seasonOrdered) ); # and rewrite the facet component
  plot(plot4);
```

This version is not spaced as well as the previous version.  You can change the bin sizes using the ***bin*** or ***binwidth*** components in ***geom_histogram***.You will be using ***bin*** and ***binwidth*** in the lesson application.

![Switching the season facet to the x-axis](images/GGP-1-06-ReverseFacet.png){#fig-columnFacets .fs}

### faceting continuous values

***facet_grid*** creates a row or column for each unique value in the column you supply in ***vars()***.  If you are not careful and use a continuous column like ***precip2***, which has 59 unique numeric values, ***facet_grid*** will attempt to make 59 columns or rows.  This will likely not work and R will either crash or time-out. 

### Modifying the histogram

Let's make two changes to the plot:

-   add color by mapping the ***season*** to ***fill*** (***fill*** is the background color)

-   change to a density plot

``` r
  #### Part 5: Adding color and switching to a density plot ####
  plot5 = ggplot( data=weatherData ) +
    «geom_density»( mapping=aes(x=avgTemp, «fill=season»),
                  color="black") +  
    theme_bw() +
    facet_grid( cols=vars(seasonOrdered)) +  # season has to be in the data frame
    labs(title = "Temperature (\u00B0F)",
         subtitle = "Lansing, Michigan: 2016",
         x = "Temperature (\u00B0F)");     
  plot(plot5);
```

![A density plot with each facet colored using the fill mapping](images/GGP-1-06-Density-Fill.png){#fig-densityPlot .fs}

## Facet in other plots

We can also use facets in a scatterplot of humidity vs. temperature faceted by season:

``` r
  #### Part 6: Faceting a scatterplot ####  
  plot6 = ggplot( data=weatherData ) +
    «geom_point»( mapping=aes(x=avgTemp, y=relHum)) +  
    theme_bw() +
    «facet_grid( rows = vars(seasonOrdered) )» +  
    labs(title = "Temperature (\u00B0F)",
         subtitle = "Lansing, Michigan: 2016",
         x = "Temperature (\u00B0F)");     
  plot(plot6);
```

![Faceting a scatterplot by season](images/GGP-1-06-facet-scatter.png){#fig-facetSeason .fs}

 

Or, use facets in a bar plot or temperature faceted by season:

``` r
  #### Part 6b: Faceting a barplot ####  
  plot6b = ggplot( data=weatherData ) +
    «geom_bar»( mapping=aes(x=avgTemp),
              color="black") +  
    theme_bw() +
    «facet_grid( rows = vars(seasonOrdered) )» +  
    labs(title = "Temperature (\u00B0F)",
         subtitle = "Lansing, Michigan: 2016",
         x = "Temperature (\u00B0F)");     
  plot(plot6b);
```

![Faceting a temperature barplot by season](images/GGP-1-06-facet-barplot.png){#fig-facetBarplot .fs}

### Different scales for the facets

By default, ***facet_grid*** will use the same scales for each facet.  In the case of *fig \##*, this means that the y-axis range for all four facets is the same.

 

We can make ***facet_grid*** use a different scale for each facet by adding the subcomponent ***scales***:

``` r
  plot6c = ggplot( data=weatherData ) +
    geom_bar( mapping=aes(x=avgTemp)) +  
    theme_bw() +
    facet_grid( cols = vars(seasonOrdered), 
                «scales="free"») +  
    labs(title = "Temperature (\u00B0F)",
         subtitle = "Lansing, Michigan: 2016",
         x = "Temperature (\u00B0F)");     
  plot(plot6c);
```

And now each facet uses a different y-axis scale to maximize space:

![Each facet row now has an independent y-axis range](images/GGP_1-07_FreeScaling.png){#fig-independentFacets .fs}

## Faceting by rows and columns 

You can do two-dimensional facet -- or, facets that have a variable for  both row and column.  We will return to our scatterplot of humidity vs. temperature and facet by season and wind speed level (i.e., low, medium, or high).

The "mappings" for this plot are:

-   x-axis: ***avgTemp***

-   y-axis: ***relHum***

-   rows: ***seasonOrdered***

-   cols: ***windSpeedLevel***

``` r
  #### Part 7: Two-dimensional facets ####
  plot7 = ggplot( data=weatherData ) +
    geom_point( mapping=aes(x=avgTemp, y=relHum)) +  
    theme_bw() +
    facet_grid( rows = vars(seasonOrdered),
                cols = vars(windSpeedLevel)) +
    labs(title = "Temperature (\u00B0F)",
         subtitle = "Lansing, Michigan: 2016",
         x = "Temperature (\u00B0F)");     
  plot(plot7);
```

Again, while facets are not defined as mappings, facets also map data to an aspect of the plot.

![Facet by both rows and columns (two-dimensional facet)](images/GGP_1_07_2D-Facet.png){#fig-2D_Facet .fs}

### Modifying the strips

The containers that have the labels for the facet rows and columns are called ***strips***.  Like everything else in the canvas area outside of the plots, the strips can be modified using ***theme***.  If you look at the [description for ***theme***](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html), under ***Usage*** you will see that there are 14 different aspects of strip that can be modified (i.e., 14 subcomponents of ***theme*** that start with ***strip***).

 

Using ***theme***, we will change the background and text colors of the strips.  And, using the subcomponent ***switch*** inside ***facet_grid***, we can change the position of the strips to the opposite side:

``` r
  plot8 = ggplot( data=weatherData ) +
    geom_point( mapping=aes(x=avgTemp, y=relHum)) +  
    theme_bw() +
    theme(«strip.text» = element_text(color="purple",
                                    size=15),
          «strip.background.x» = element_rect(color="red",
                                            fill="yellow"),
          «strip.background.y» = element_rect(color="blue",
                                            fill="lightgreen")) +
    facet_grid( rows = vars(seasonOrdered),
                cols = vars(windSpeedLevel),
                «switch = "both"») +  # could use "x" or "y" to switch only 1 axis
    labs(title = "Temperature (\u00B0F)",
         subtitle = "Lansing, Michigan: 2016",
         x = "Temperature (\u00B0F)");     
  plot(plot8);
```

***strip***.***text*** and ***strip.background*** will modify both axis.  Individual axis can be modified by attaching ***.x*** or .***y*** to the names. So, ***strip.text*** modifies both axis text whereas ***strip.background.x*** modifies only the x-axis.

![Modifying the strips in the canvas](images/GGP_1-07_ModifyStrips.png){#fig-modifyStrips .fs}

### Themes and element objects

Like most ***theme*** components, you cannot directly set the properties of an object, instead you set the object to an ***element\_\**** that has the properties you want so:

``` r
strip.background.y = element_rect(color="blue",
                                  fill="lightgreen"))
```

... means set the **strips** on the **y-axis** to a **rectangular element** that is **colored** blue and **filled** lightgreen.

## Facet_wrap

So far the positioning of the facets is determined by how many categories (or factors), the variable has.

 

***season*** has 4 factors (categories) and using ***season*** as a facet will give 4 columns.  Another option is to use ***facet_wrap***, which will allow you facet by one or more variable and define the number of rows and columns.

### One variable facet_wrap

We will use ***windSusDir*** to facet the humidity vs temperature scatterplot.

 

***windSusDir*** gives wind by 10 degrees, so the values are 10, 20, 30, ..., 360.  This means that are **36** values for ***windSusDir***.  A regular facet would be either **36** rows or columns.

 

With ***facet_wrap***, we can split the facets into rows and columns by setting either ***nrow*** or ***ncol***:

``` r
  plot9 = ggplot( data=weatherData ) +
    geom_point( mapping=aes(x=avgTemp, y=relHum)) +  
    theme_bw() +
    «facet_wrap( facets = vars(windSusDir),»
                «nrow = 4)» +
    labs(title = "Temperature (\u00B0F)",
         subtitle = "Lansing, Michigan: 2016",
         x = "Temperature (\u00B0F)");     
  plot(plot9);
```

We only set ***nrow*** (4)-- and GGPlot calculates ***ncol*** (9).  You could declare both ***nrow*** and ***ncol*** but that is not necessary and you are risking an error if you calculate it wrong.

![A facet_wrap using one variable](images/GGP_1-07_FacetWrap-1-01.png){#fig-facetWrap .fs}

### Multi-variable facet_wrap

You can facet with multiple variables and GGPlot will produce one facet cell for every possible combination of the variables.  In this example, we facet by ***seasonOrdered*** and ***windSpeedLevel***.  ***seasonOrdered*** has **4** possible values and ***windSpeedLevel*** has **3**.  So, the combination will produce **12** facet cells:

``` r
  plot10 = ggplot( data=weatherData ) +
    geom_point( mapping=aes(x=avgTemp, y=relHum)) +  
    theme_bw() +
    facet_wrap( «facets = vars(seasonOrdered, windSpeedLevel»),
                ncol = 4,
                dir = "v") +   # order facets vertically
    labs(title = "Temperature (\u00B0F)",
         subtitle = "Lansing, Michigan: 2016",
         x = "Temperature (\u00B0F)");     
  plot(plot10);
```

GGPlot creates 12 facets, one for each combination of seasonOrdered and winSpeedLevel.  ***ncol=4*** says to create 4 columns -- and 3 rows.  ***dir="v"*** says arrange the facets vertically.  The default is "h", or horizontally.

![Facet_wrap using 2 variables](images/GGP_1-07_Facet_Wrap-2Vars.png){#fig-facetWrap_2Var .fs}

## Application

Create a script file in your Project's ***scripts*** folder called ***app07.r*** and, using the data from **Lansing2016NOAA.csv:**

1\) Make a scatterplot of temperature vs. humidity and

-   facet by wind speed level in the ***x*** direction

-   facet by wind direction in the ***y*** direction

-   have wind speed go in descending order (high -\> medium -\> low)

-   have wind direction go north -\> south -\> east -\> west

 

2\) Using the plot from *fig \##*

-   The 2 tasks below both use a ***strip.\**** subcomponent in the ***theme*** component

    -   Change the background color and outline color of the facet labels

    -   Change the text size, color, and font type inside the facet

-   Double the size of the bins using either bin or binwidth (they are both subcomponents of geom_histogram)

-   Add fill mapping to season

-   Set the season fill colors to spring: green, summer: red, fall: orange, winter: purple

-   Change breaks on x-axis to 25, 35, ..., 85

-   Change limits on x-axis to see all the breaks

 

3\) Create a scatterplot of temperature vs. humidity and facet by months (in order)

-   For help, look at *extension: dates redux*. 

-   Modify the axes' ranges to only include values within the facet (i.e., ***scales*** subcomponent)

 

4\) Create a scatterplot of temperature vs. humidity and facet_wrap using any 3 variables 

-   Set the number of columns so that it is between 1.5x and 2x the number of rows.

-   [Note 1: you might need to click the Zoom button in the RStudio ***Plot*** tab to properly see the results]{.note}

-   [Note 2: you want to use variables with a small number of factors!]{.note}

### Questions

Answer the following in comments inside your application script:

1.  What was your level of comfort with the lesson/application?

2.  What areas of the lesson/application confused or still confuses you?

3.  What are some things you would like to know more about that is related to, but not covered in, this lesson?

## Extension: dates redux

We are going to facet the temperature humidity scatterplot by month -- so, there will be 12 facets but only one faceting variable.

### Create a date facet

Dates are not the easiest thing to deal with in R, so it is worth a revisit.  Our goal is to facet by month using the ***dateYr*** column and it would really help if R could recognize the values as dates.  Unfortunately, R does not see ***dateYr*** as Date values:

``` r
> typeof(weatherData$dateYr)
[1] "character"
```

So, we need to convert ***dateYr*** into a ***Date*** format that R recognizes -- we will save that to ***dateYr2***:

``` r
  dateYr2 = as.Date(weatherData$dateYr, format="%Y-%m-%d");
```

And the ***Environment*** says ***dateYr2*** is a ***Date*** vector:

``` r
dateYr2:   Date[1:366], format:...
```

But ***typeof()*** will classify ***dateYr2*** as numeric (double) -- this is because, deep down, ***Dates*** are stored as a number that counts from January 1, 1970 (backwards and forewords).

``` r
> typeof(dateYr2)
[1] "double"
```

Now we can extract the month from ***dateYr2***, [note: "%b" is the conversion specification for month]{.note}

``` r
  months = format(dateYr2, format="%b");
```

We need to add ***months*** in the data frame before we use it as a facet:

``` r
  weatherData$monthsCol = months;
```

### Putting the months in order

GGPlot will order the ***months*** alphabetically because GGPlot sees the values as characters -- not dates.  To get GGPlot to facet the months in order, you will need to factor ***months*** using ***factor()***. ([Factoring data])***.\
